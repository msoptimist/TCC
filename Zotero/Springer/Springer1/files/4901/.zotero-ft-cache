Abstract

Social media analysis is a fast growing research area aimed at extracting useful information from social networks. Recent years have seen a great interest from academic and business world in using social media to measure public opinion. This paper presents a methodology aimed at discovering the behavior of social network users and how news sites are used during political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of different factions. As a case study, we present an analysis on the constitutional referendum that was held in Italy on December 4, 2016. A first goal of the analysis was to study how Twitter users expressed their voting intentions about the referendum in the weeks before the voting day, so as to understand how the voting trends have evolved before the vote, e.g., if there have been changes in the voting intentions. According to our study, 48% of Twitter users were polarized toward no , 25% toward yes , and 27% had a neutral behavior. A second goal was to understand the effects of news sites on the referendum campaign. The analysis has shown that some news sites had a strong polarization toward yes (unita.tv, ilsole24ore.it and linkiesta.it), some others had a neutral position (lastampa.it, corriere.it, huffingtonpost.it and repubblica.it) and others were oriented toward no (ilfattoquotidiano.it, ilgiornale.it and beppegrillo.it).

1 Introduction

In the last years, the production rate of digital data has increased exponentially, with a great contribution from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Qzone and Instagram. The large volumes of data generated and gathered by social media platforms can be used to extract valuable information regarding human dynamics and behaviors (Belcastro et al. 2017 ). Social media analysis is a fast growing research area aimed at extracting useful information from this big amount of data (Talia et al. 2015 ). For example, it is used for the analysis of collective sentiments (Pang and Lee 2008 ), for understanding the behavior of groups of people (Cesario et al. 2015 , 2016 ), and to improve the communication between companies and customers (Hanna et al. 2011 ).

Recently, there has been a great interest from academic and business world for using social media to measure public opinion (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2015 ). Several researchers have used social media data for predicting election results (Franch 2013 ), measuring how public opinion changes after important political debates (Elmer 2013 ) or studying the effects of social media during important recent historical events (e.g., Arab Spring Howard et al. 2011 ). Other researchers have examined the impact of social media spaces on news consumption (Hermida et al. 2012 ) and on how information spreads through social networks (Lerman and Ghosh 2010 ).

This paper presents a methodology aimed at discovering the behavior of social network users and how news sites are used during political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of different factions. The methodology is composed of five steps: (1) definition of the factions and collection of the keywords associated with a political event; (2) collection of all the posts generated by social network users containing one or more keywords defined at first step; (3) preprocessing of the posts and creation of the input dataset; (4) data analysis and mining; and (5) results visualization. On the one hand, the methodology allows to study the users’ polarization before a political event, what arguments they used to support their voting intentions, and if such intentions change in the weeks preceding the vote. On the other hand, the methodology allows to study the effects of news sites on a political event, e.g., how many users used information from news sites to support their voting intentions and what news sites can be considered in favor, against or neutral to a given faction.

Unlike works in the literature that classify a post manually (Gruzd and Roy 2014 ) or with text mining techniques (Ceron et al. 2014 ; Burnap et al. 2016 ; Tumasjan et al. 2010 ), the methodology exploits keywords contained in a post to classify it in favor of a faction. In this way, a post is classified in favor of a faction only if it shows a clear voting indication for a such faction; otherwise, we consider the post as neutral. With regard to studying the polarization of news sites, different works in literature use a direct approach that analyzes the contents of articles published by such news sites to understand their political orientation (Wagner 2017 ; Dallmann et al. 2015 ). Our approach instead uses a novel approach that analyzes how users referred to these news sites in their posts for supporting their voting intentions. Other aspects of novelty of the methodology are some analyses we have proposed such as statistical significance of collected data, mobility flows and polarization prediction.

Although the methodology is able to analyze political events characterized by n -factions, in this paper we focus on a subset of political events distinguished by the rivalry of only two factions (i.e., two-faction political events ). This subset includes salient political events, such as referenda that see the opposition of two factions (e.g., in favor of yes or no ) or ballots (runoff voting) that see the opposition of two candidates competing for the final victory. These events are characterized by some interesting features that make them interesting to study: (1) People show a special attention and sensitivity to these events as they are very important for a nation; (2) people present a strong polarization in favor of one of the two factions, and this allows separating them in two distinct groups; (3) accurate analysis can be done since each user can choose only between two values.

As a case study, we present an analysis on the constitutional referendum that was held in Italy on December 4, 2016. The Italian voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy. The main supporter of yes was the Democratic Party and its leader and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whereas in favor of no were the main opposition parties and several citizen committees. The referendum saw a high voter turnout (approximately 65% of voters) and a clear victory of no (59% of the expressed preferences).

In the weeks before the referendum, we identified a number of keywords (i.e., hashtags) that were used in Twitter to publish neutral posts on the referendum, for supporting either yes or no . We collected 338,592 tweets (1,165,176 if we also consider retweets) that contained those hashtags from October 23 (5 weeks before the voting day) to December 3, 2016 (1 day before). The number of Twitter users under analysis is 50,717 (139,066 considering also those who published a retweet).

A first goal of the analysis was to study how Twitter users expressed their voting intentions about the referendum in the weeks before the voting day, so as to understand how the voting trends have evolved before the vote, e.g., if there have been changes in the voting intentions. According to our study, 48% of Twitter users were polarized toward no , 25% toward yes , and 27% had a neutral behavior. Regarding the change of opinion in the weeks preceding the vote, the majority of users categorized as supporters of no have never changed during the weeks preceding the vote, while a consistent part of the neutral users moved toward no . A second goal was to understand the effects of news sites on the referendum campaign. The 22% of tweets contained URLs to news related to the referendum. The analysis has shown that some news sites had a strong polarization toward yes (unita.tv, ilsole24ore.it and linkiesta.it), some others had a neutral position (lastampa.it, corriere.it, huffingtonpost.it and repubblica.it) and others toward no (ilfattoquotidiano.it, ilgiornale.it and beppegrillo.it).

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section  2 describes the methodology proposed in this paper. Sections  3 and 4 describe, respectively, how the methodology has been exploited on the Italian constitutional referendum and which results have been achieved. Section  5 discusses related work. Finally, Sect.  6 concludes the paper.
2 Methodology
Given a political event \({\mathcal {P}}\) to be analyzed, five are the main steps of the proposed methodology:

    1.

    Definition of the factions F and collection of the keywords K associated with \({\mathcal {P}}\) ;
     
    2.

    Collection of all the posts P generated by social network users containing one or more keywords in K ;
     
    3.

    Preprocessing of P and creation of the input dataset D ;
     
    4.

    Data analysis and mining of dataset D ;
     
    5.

    Results visualization.
     

2.1 Definition of the factions F and collection of the keywords K associated with \({\mathcal {P}}\)
The political event \({\mathcal {P}}\) is characterized by the rivalry of different factions \(F=\{f_1, f_2,\ldots , f_n\}\) . Examples of political events and relative factions are: (1) municipal election, in which a faction supports a mayor candidate; (2) political election, in which a faction supports a party; (3) presidential election, in which a faction supports a presidential candidate. In this step, we collect the main keywords K used by social network users to write posts associated with \({\mathcal {P}}\) . The keywords can be divided in different subsets, e.g., \(K = K_{\mathrm{neutral}} \cup K_{f1}\cup \cdots \cup K_{fn}\) as described below:

    The general keywords that can be associated with \({\mathcal {P}}\) but cannot be associated with any factions in F (i.e., are neutral ) are assigned to \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}}\) .

    For each faction \(f_i \in F\) , \(K_{fi}\) contains the keywords used to support \(f_i\) .

In this paper, we focus on a subset of political events characterized by the rivalry of only two factions \(F=\{f_1, f_2\}\) . Examples of two-faction events are: (1) referendum , in which a faction supports a position (e.g., in favor of yes or no ); (2) ballot (or runoff voting), in which a faction is one of the two candidates competing for the final victory. For these events, the keywords are divided in three subsets, \(K = K_{\mathrm{neutral}} \cup K_{f1}\cup K_{f2}\) , where \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}}\) contains the neutral keywords, \(K_{f1}\) and \(K_{f2}\) are the keywords associated, respectively, with \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) .
2.2 Collection of all the posts P generated by social network users containing one or more keywords in K

Through the API provided by social networks, we download all the posts containing one or more keywords in K . The posts are not collected in real time, but downloaded a given time after their publication (e.g., 24 h). In this way, we are able to get some statistics related to the popularity of a post. For example: (1) number of shares , which indicates how many users shared a post with their friends; (2) number of likes , which indicates how many users found a post useful. Each collected post has at least one key in K , but may have also other keywords ( co-keywords ) that are useful to understand the arguments used to support the voting intentions.
2.3 Preprocessing of P and creation of the input dataset D
The goal of this phase is to preprocess the posts in P to make them ready for the subsequent analysis. Specifically, after preprocessing each post \(p \in P\) is structured as a tuple \(\langle\) user, text, timestamp, keywords, statistics, URLs, domains, class \(\rangle\) where

    user is the identification of the user who published p ;

    text is the text of the post;

    timestamp is the timestamp indicating when p was published;

    statistics contains some statistic data about p ;

    keywords contains the keywords of p ;

    URLs contains all the URLs present in p ;

    domains contains, for each \(u \in\) URLs , the corresponding domain names;

    class is a label that indicates how a post is classified.

The following operations are performed to preprocess the keywords , URLs and domains fields: (1) All the keywords are transformed to be lowercase and without accented letters (e.g., IOVOTOSI or iovotosí \(\rightarrow\) iovotosi); (2) all the short URLs are changed into the corresponding long URLs (for example larep.it \(\rightarrow\) repubblica.it); (3) all the alias domains are changed into a single domain (e.g., beppegrillo.it and beppegrillo.com \(\rightarrow\) beppegrillo.it).

The class label is computed by analyzing the keywords of a post. A post may be labeled as one of the classes neutral , \(\{f_1, f_2,\ldots , f_n\}\) . Considering the keywords \(\{K_{\mathrm{neutral}}, K_{f1},\ldots , K_{fn}\}\) , Table  1 reports how a post p is associated with one of the factions \(f_1,\ldots , f_n\) or classified as neutral . A post is classified as \(f_i\) if it contains at least one keywords in \(K_{fi}\) , possibly some keywords in \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}}\) , but no one in other factions \(\{K_{f1},\ldots ,K_{fi-1},K_{fi+1},\ldots , K_{fn}\}\) . A post is categorized as neutral if has keywords in \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}}\) and/or keywords in two or many factions \(\{K_{f1},\ldots , K_{fn}\}\) . Although there are other approaches in the literature for classifying a post (e.g., manually or with text mining techniques), through our approach, a post is classified in favor of a given faction by analyzing the keywords contained in it, i.e., only if it shows a clear voting indication for that faction; otherwise, we consider the post as neutral .
In the case of two-faction events, a post may be labeled as one of the three classes \(\{\) neutral , \(f_1, f_2\}\) . Considering the keywords \(\{K_{\mathrm{neutral}}, K_{f1}, K_{f2}\}\) , Table  2 reports how a post p is associated with one of the two factions \(f_1\) , \(f_2\) or classified as neutral . A post is classified as \(f_1\) if it contains at least one keywords in \(K_{f1}\) and possibly some keywords in \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}}\) . Similarly, a post is classified as \(f_2\) if it contains at least one keywords in \(K_{f2}\) and possibly some keywords in \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}}\) . A post is categorized as neutral if it has keywords in \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}}\) and/or keywords in all the two factions \(\{K_{f1}, K_{f2}\}\) .

2.4 Data analysis and mining of dataset D
After having built the input dataset D , it is analyzed through algorithms and techniques for discovering the polarization of social network users and news sites during political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of different factions. In particular, the main goals of this step are as follows.

    1.

    Analysis of aggregate data D is analyzed to derive statistics about data and to discover the main arguments used by the different factions whose posts are present in \(P\) .
     
    2.

    Statistical significance of collected data The goal is to assess the significance of D .
     
    3.

    Temporal analysis The goal is to analyze how the number of posts supporting the different factions vary along time.
     
    4.

    Polarization of users Collected data are analyzed to discover how users are polarized toward the different factions.
     
    5.

    Mobility flows The evolution of users’ polarization is studied in the weeks preceding the political event.
     
    6.

    Polarization prediction The goal is to predict the polarization of users before the political event.
     
    7.

    Polarization of news sites Collected data are analyzed to discover how news site is polarized toward the different factions.
     

2.5 Results visualization

Results visualization is performed by the creation of info-graphics aimed at presenting the results in a way that is easy to understand to the general public, without providing complex statistical details that may be hard to understand to the intended audience. The graphic project is grounded on some of the most acknowledged and ever-working principles underpinning a ‘good’ info-graphic piece. In particular, we follow three main design guidelines: (1) preferring a visual representation of the quantitative information to the written one; (2) minimizing the cognitive efforts necessary to decoding each system of signs; and (3) structuring the whole proposed elements into graphic hierarchies (Cesario et al. 2016 ).

Displaying quantitative information by visual means instead of just using numeric symbols—or at least a combination of the two approaches—has been proven extremely useful in providing a kind of sensory evidence to the inherent abstraction of numbers, because this allows everybody to instantly grasp similarities and differences among values. In fact, basic visual metaphors (e.g., the largest is the greatest, the thickest is the highest) enable more natural ways of understanding and relating sets of quantities (Tufte 198 ).
3 Case of study: Italian constitutional referendum, 2016

We applied the methodology described in the previous section to the constitutional referendum that was held in Italy on December 4, 2016. The Italian voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, as well as the division of powers between the State, regions, and administrative entities. 1 The main supporter of the referendum (i.e., in favor of yes ) was the Democratic Party (in Italian Partito Democratico, PD) and its leader and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, on the other hand, in favor of no the main opposition parties (e.g., Movimento 5 Stelle, Forza Italia) and different citizen committees. The referendum saw a high voter turnout (approximately 65% of voters) and a majority of the votes opposed to the reform (i.e., voting no ), which exceeded 59% of the expressed preferences. A political effect of the referendum’s result was the resignation of the Italian prime minister.
The political event under analysis \({\mathcal {P}}\) is a two-faction event \(F=\{yes,no\}\) . We collected the main keywords K used as hashtags in tweets related to \({\mathcal {P}}\) . Such keywords have been grouped as follows:

    \(K_{\mathrm{neutral}} = \{\) #referendumcostituzionale, #siono, #riformacostituzionale, #referendum, #4dicembre, #referendum4dicembre \(\}\)

    \(K_{\mathrm{yes}} = \{\) #bastaunsi, #iovotosi,#italiachedicesi, #iodicosi, #leragionidelsi \(\}\)

    \(K_{\mathrm{no}} = \{\) #iovotono, #iodicono, #bastaunno, #famiglieperilno, #leragionidelno \(\}\)

Given the keywords \(K = K_{\mathrm{neutral}} \cup K_{\mathrm{yes}} \cup K_{\mathrm{no}}\) , we collected 338,592 tweets containing at least one of these keywords posted from October 23 (5 weeks before the voting day) to December 3, 2016 (1 day before). The tweets were not collected in real time, but with a delay of 24 h after their publications so as to capture: (1) the number of retweet , which indicates how many users shared a tweet with their friends; (2) the number of favorites , which indicates how many users found a tweet useful.
Collected tweets were preprocessed as described in Sect.  2.3 . For instance, Table  3 shows three tweets published by a user \(u_i\) before the voting day (translated in English for the Reader’s convenience). For each tweet, the main fields have been reported in the table.

In the first tweet, \(u_i\) expresses the importance of going to vote by using a neutral hashtag (#ReferendumCostituzionale) and including a Youtube URL. This tweet is classified as neutral . In the second tweet, \(u_i\) shows his/her dissatisfaction with the reform by using a hashtag supporting no (#iovotono) and two news sites for motivating his/her voting intention. It is classified as in favor of no . The third tweet contains a neutral hashtag (#referendum4dicembre), a hashtag supporting no (#iovotono) and a co-hashtag (#democrazia). This tweet is classified as in favor of no .
4 Analysis and results
4.1 Analysis of aggregate data
Table  4 reports some statistics about the tweets collected: 338,592 are tweets, 826,584 are retweets and 987,010 are favorites. Filtering the data, we discovered that 43% of tweets contain co-hashtags (e.g., #democrazia, #renzi) and 22% contain URLs. Co-hashtags are useful to understand the arguments used in favor of one or another position. The URLs allows understanding what news site were used by users to support their voting intentions. The number of users under analysis is 50,717 (139,066 considering also the retweets). Figure  1 shows that more than half (54%) of the users published only one tweet on the referendum, 14% two tweets, 7% three, 4% four and 21% five or more tweets.

Table  5 reports some statistics about the main hashtags used for collecting tweets, grouped in yes , neutral and no . Next to each hashtag, the number of tweets, retweets and favorites containing such hashtags are reported. The percentage of tweets published with yes or neutral hashtags are similar (respectively, 23 and 24%) and are both half of those in favor of no (53%). We also studied how users have used these hashtags to write their tweets: 88% of tweets contain only one or more hashtags of a group ( yes , neutral or no ), 11% of tweets contain hashtags of two groups (yes/neutral, no/neutral or yes/no), and 1% of tweets contain hashtags of all the groups (yes/neutral/no).

Table  6 shows the main ten co-hashtags used by Twitter users, divided into yes , neutral and no . We note that, in many cases, users who supported yes did it by posting tweets reporting Prime Minister’s statements (e.g., #matteorisponde), the opportunity to improve the political system (e.g., #avanti) or information propagated by opponents (e.g., #lebufaledelno). On the other hand, users supporting no posted tweets reporting positions from the political opposition (e.g., #m5s, #salvini), willing to leave the constitution as it is (e.g., #costituzione) or hoping to send the prime minister home (e.g., #renziacasa). The neutral co-hashtags highlight topics that were treated during the referendum campaign.

4.2 Statistical significance of collected data

The goal is to assess the statistical significance of the input dataset. Specifically, we studied whether the Twitter users captured in our analysis were actual voters of the referendum, i.e., whether they were Italian citizens able to vote (at least 18 years old).

From the metadata present in the tweets used in our analysis, we extracted aggregate information on the language used to write them and on the location of users who wrote them. Specifically, from the tweet metadata we analyzed the lang field, 2 which is a language identifier corresponding to the machine-detected language of the Tweet text (e.g., “en” for English, “it” for Italian, “und” if no language could be detected). In addition, from the user metadata we analyzed the location field, 3 which indicates the user-defined location for the accounts profile (e.g., San Francisco, CA).
By analyzing the metadata described above, we can say that:

    All the tweets under analysis have the lang field equals to “it” (Italian). The Italian language is mainly used by Italians who reside in Italy (60 million) or abroad (about 4 million). Italian is used as first language 4 only by a small part of Swiss (about 640,000 people), and a very small part of Croats and Slovenes (about 22.000 people).

    98% of users who have defined the location in their profile live in Italy.

To further show the statistical value of user locations, in Table  7 we compared the number of Twitter users captured in our analysis with the total number of citizens grouped by Italian regions. There is a strong correlation (Pearson coefficient 0.9) between these sets of data. Similar results are obtained by comparing the number of users and the total number of citizen grouped by Italian cities. Also in this case, as shown in Table  8 there is a very strong correlation between these sets of data (Pearson coefficient 0.96).
These statistics give us strong indications about the users analyzed in our case study: It is highly likely that they are voters of the referendum that is adult Italians citizen. Regarding the last point, statistics show that 96% of Italian Twitter users are adults. 5

4.3 Temporal Analysis
Figure  2 shows the time series of the number of tweets published during the 5 weeks preceding the referendum. The tweets in the figure are classified as supporting yes (solid blue line), neutral (black dashed line), or no (solid red line). A fourth time series on all the tweets is represented as a solid black line.
Open image in new window
Fig. 2

Time series of tweets published from 23rd October to 3rd December 2016
All four time series have a similar growing trends (Pearson coefficients of the yes , neutral and no series versus the all series range from 0.87 to 0.97) and show some peaks in the following dates:

    29th October: It was the day after a major television confrontation between Matteo Renzi in favor of yes and the former PM Ciriaco De Mita in favor of no ; 6

    12th and 23rd November: Debates and discussions in different cities of Italy in favor of yes or no ;

    2nd December: The last day to make propaganda before the election silence day (3rd December).

We observe that, during the whole observation period, tweets supporting no were more than those supporting yes or neutral . Statistically, every day the number of tweets supporting neutral or yes is similar, and they both are half of the tweets supporting no .
Figure  3 shows the number of tweets aggregated by week day. The interest on referendum increases from Monday to Friday and then decreases during the weekend.

4.4 Polarization of users
Polarization of a user \(\rho _{u} \in [-1,1]\) is defined as
$$\begin{aligned} \rho _{u} = 2 \times \frac{|yes _{u}|}{|yes _{u}| + |no _{u}|} - 1, \end{aligned}$$
where \(|yes _{u}|\) and \(|no _{u}|\) represent, respectively, the number of tweets published by u classified as yes and no (Bessi et al. 2015 ). A value of \(\rho _{u}\) close to 1 means that user u tends to be polarized toward yes , while when \(\rho _{u}\) is close to \(-1\) it means that user u is polarized toward no . In all the analyses of our paper, we focused on users who showed a strong polarization toward a given faction. For this reason, we chose a high threshold (0.9) to select users with strong polarization in favor of yes or no . Specifically, we consider users with \(\rho _{u} > 0.9\) as polarized toward yes , users with \(\rho _{u} < -0.9\) as polarized toward no , otherwise neutral . Figure  4 shows the probability density function of the users’ polarization. We observe a trimodal distribution, indicating that a group of users are polarized toward yes , another one has a neutral polarization, and another one polarized toward no . Specifically, the 48% of users under analysis have a strong polarization toward no , 25% toward yes , and 27% are neutral .

Probability density function of the users’ polarization
Figure  5 illustrates production patterns of polarized users. In particular, the figure shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the number of tweets published by users polarized toward yes and toward no . Both curves point out very similar production patterns between users polarized toward yes and users polarized toward no (Lievrouw et al. 2014 ). The number of tweets posted by a user does not depend on its polarization: There are a similar number of users who have published at least x tweets among users polarized both toward no and toward yes .

4.5 Mobility flows

Figure  6 represents the evolution of users’ polarization in the 5 weeks preceding the referendum. To study the mobility flows of users, we restricted our analysis on users who have published at least 5 tweets (i.e., 10,436 users). The figure shows how vary the number of users polarized toward yes (blue circles), the number of users polarized toward no (red circles), and the number of neutral users (gray circles) in the 5 weeks preceding the referendum. Arrows in the figure show the percentage of users who after 1 week are polarized as in the previous week and the percentage of neutral users who move toward yes or no . We do not report the moving from yes toward no (and viceversa) because they are low numbers (less than 3%). Notice that the number of users under analysis increase from week to week (from 1520 to 10,436), because by collecting new tweets we are able to categorize new users.

We observe that, over the 5 weeks preceding the referendum, the vast majority of users polarized toward yes and no tend to maintain their polarization. The biggest changes occur only among users categorized as neutral : 10% of neutral users moves toward the yes and 20% toward the no .
We can conclude that almost all users polarized toward no have not changed position during the weeks preceding the vote, and one fifth of the neutral users moved toward no . Also supporters of the yes were very compact, while a lower number of neutral users have moved to yes .

4.6 Polarization prediction

The goal of this section is to predict the polarization of users before the referendum day. Different machine learning techniques has been studied to evaluate their appropriateness in the considered domain. Among those, some classification algorithms have been tested and the Random Forest (RF) (Breiman 2001 ) algorithm was selected as it achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy and recall, with limited model building time. Other research works exploited RF for social media analysis due to its high level of accuracy (e.g., see Zhang et al. 2011 ; Gokulakrishnan et al. 2012 ; Monti et al. 2013 ), (Kwon et al. 2013 ).
Random Forests have been trained for predicting the polarization that a user will have before the voting day, by using information available n weeks before the referendum, where n varies from 5 to 1. Specifically, we trained five Random Forest models (one for each value of n ), each of them trained from this information:

    The input is composed by aggregate information contained in tweets posted by a user at least n weeks before the referendum. This information is: (1) number of tweets containing yes hashtags, (2) number of tweets containing no hashtags, (3) number of tweets containing neutral hashtags, (4) total number of tweets and (5) number of hashtags used.

    The class is a label that indicates the final polarization of a user ( yes , no or neutral ) calculated by our methodology using all the information contained in all the tweets posted by a user (i.e., it does not depend on n ).

To fine-tune the model, we performed a grid search over the parameters’ space and we found that the best results are provided by a Random Forest using the entropy criterion and 128 estimators.
Figure  7 shows the classification performance achieved by RF models at different times. In particular, we show micro- and macro-averaging (Van Asch 2013 ) of the area under the curve (AUC) computed for the model trained with information available at different times. Results are averaged over 10 Monte Carlo cross-validation iterations and indicate that the information available 5 weeks before the referendum day provide a classification performance of \(0.849 \pm 0.006\) (micro-AUC) and \(0.83 \pm 0.006\) (macro AUC). Such a classification performance increases with the amount of information available, reaching the value of \(0.962 \pm 0.002\) (micro-AUC) and \(0.949 \pm 0.001\) (micro-AUC) 1 week before the referendum day.

4.7 Polarization of news sites
Table  9 reports some statistics about tweets containing URLs from the main Italian news sites. Almost 3/4 of such tweets contain URLs from five of the major news sites: beppegrillo.it (36%), ilfattoquotidiano (17%), repubblica.it (12%), huffingtonpost.it (8%) and corriere.it (5%). Since we have registered a greater presence of tweets supporting no , the popularity of news sites was been affected if the magazine has written articles close to the positions of no .

Given a news site s , we compute its polarization as follows
$$\begin{aligned} \rho _{s} = 2 \times \frac{|yes _{s}|}{|yes _{s}| + |no _{s}|} - 1, \end{aligned}$$
where \(|yes _{s}|\) and \(|no _{s}|\) represent, respectively, the number of tweets classified as yes and no that contain a URL linking to the news site s . Figure  8 shows the polarization of the main Italian news sites for each category ( yes , neutral and no ). The figure highlights that some journals had a strong polarization toward yes (unita.tv, ilsole24ore.it and linkiesta.it), some others had a neutral position (lastampa.it, corriere.it, huffingtonpost.it and repubblica.it) and others toward no (ilfattoquotidiano.it, ilgiornale.it and beppegrillo.it). This result can be explained in two ways: news sites that for editorial choices have supported the campaign of yes or no , or readers of a certain news site that for political reasons are closer to a certain position.
Figure  9 shows the evolution of the polarization of four representative news sites over the 5 weeks preceding the referendum day. The figure clearly indicates that the polarization of news sites does not show relevant changes over time.

5 Related work

In recent years, the use of social media for measuring public opinion has become one of the hot topics in social network research (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2015 ). In particular, two are the main areas of research related to this paper: (1) the use of social media to measure public opinion and predict election results and (2) the impact of social media on news consumption and on how information spreads through social networks. For each of these research areas, the main related work has been described.

Murphy et al. ( 2014 ) examined the potential impact of social media on public opinion research, as an important way for facilitating and/or replacing traditional survey research methods. The authors highlighted several problems related to this topic, for example, (1) not every member of the public uses social network platforms; (2) incomplete and not accurate information published by social users; (3) legal regulations about data collected. O’Connor et al. ( 2010 ) correlated Twitter data with several public opinion time series; Anstead and O’Loughlin (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2015 ), by analyzing the 2010 UK election, suggested the use of social media as a new way to understand public opinion. Others related work attempted to measure the publics evolving response to stimuli, examining both short-term events such as TV political debates (Elmer 201 ) or long-term events such as economic downturns (Gonzalez-Bailon et al. 2010 ). An in-depth survey on this topic can be found in Jungherr ( 2016 ).

Hermida et al. ( 2012 ) have examined the impact of social media on news consumption, based on an online survey of 1600 Canadians. The study highlights that social networks are a significant source of news for Canadians: Two-fifths of users under analysis said that they received news from users who they follow, while a fifth got information from news organizations and individual journalists who they follow. Lerman and Ghosh (Lerman and Ghosh 2010 ) studied the spread of information on social networks and if their network structure affect how information is disseminated. Specifically, they extracted the active users and track how the interest in news spreads among them. Howard et al. (Howard et al. 2011 ) studied the effects of social media during the Arab Spring. 7 By analyzing users posts from different social networks, the authors have reached three main conclusions: (1) Social media played a central role in guiding the political debates during such event; (2) a spike in online conversations often preceded major events in the real world; and (3) social media helped to accelerate the spreading of news and ideas in the world.

To highlight the level of novelty of the methodology we proposed, in the following we review some of the most related research works by discussing differences and similarities with our work. Ceron et al. (Ceron et al. 2014 ) used a text analysis approach (Hopkins and King 2010 ) for studying the voting intention of French Internet users in both the 2012 Presidential ballot and the subsequent legislative election. The authors mainly present the results of their analysis by comparing them with official data and predictions made by survey companies. Very few are the implementation details, e.g., it is not clear how the statistical value of data was assessed and how tweets and users were classified. Gruzd and Roy ( 2014 ) investigated the political polarization of social network users during the Canadian Federal Election, 2011. A sample of tweets posted by 1492 Twitter users were manually classified based on their self-declared political views and affiliations. The methodology we proposed allows to classify a user automatically by analyzing the posts he/she published—and the keywords he/she used—in the weeks preceding the vote. Nulty et al. ( 2016 ) surveyed the European landscape of social media using tweets originating from and referring to political actors during the 2014 European Parliament election campaign. With respect to our paper, these authors do not present a methodology, but only a hashtag analysis per languages, political parties and candidates. Burnap et al. (Burnap et al. 2016 ) used Twitter data to forecast the outcome of UK General Election, 2015. The authors applied an automated sentiment analysis tool for classifying tweets. Differently from this methodology, we classified user posts—and consequently users who wrote these posts—by taking advantage of the keywords related to the political event under analysis. Similar considerations can be made for Tumasjan et al. ( 2010 ) that analyzed about 100.000 political tweets on 2009 German federal election using a text analysis software. Kagan et al. ( 2015 ) exploited Twitter data for predicting the electoral results of 2013 Pakistan and 2014 Indian elections. The authors studied how the support for a candidate (or opposition to a candidate) was spreading through Internet. In fact, the diffusion model proposed classifies a user by taking into account also the percentage of his/her neighbors (i.e., friends) that have expressed a positive/negative opinion on a candidate/faction. With respect to this work, our methodology evaluates only the content of posts published by a user, but it could be extended considering the opinion of friends of such user. Wagner (Wagner 2017 ) studied the 2014 Scottish independence referendum for understanding how local newspapers supported the campaign of the referendum. Specifically, the author has analyzed the political position of two local Scottish newspapers (i.e., The Courier and Evening Telegraph), by counting how many stories were neutral, in favor of, and opposed to Scottish independence. With respect to our work, this is a traditional approach that analyzes the textual content of articles published by a news site. We proposed to evaluate the political position of a news site by analyzing how users referred to such news site for supporting their voting intentions. Similar considerations can be made for Dallmann et al. ( 2015 ) that analyzed the behavior of four leading German online newspapers over a timespan of four years.
In summary, this paper presents a methodology aimed at analyzing the polarization of social network users and news sites during political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of two factions (e.g., referenda and ballots). Unlike works in literature that classify a post manually (Gruzd and Roy 2014 ) or with text mining techniques (Ceron et al. 2014 ; Burnap et al. 2016 ; Tumasjan et al. 2010 ), our methodology exploits keywords (e.g., hashtags) contained in a post to classify it in favor of a faction. In this way, a post is classified in favor of a faction only if it shows a clear voting indication for a such faction, otherwise we consider the post as neutral. With regard to studying the polarization of news sites, different works in literature use a direct approach that analyzes the contents of articles published by such news sites to understand their political orientation (Wagner 2017 ; Dallmann et al. 2015 ). Our approach instead uses a novel approach that analyzes how users referred to these news sites in their posts for supporting their voting intentions. Other aspects of novelty of the methodology are some analyses we have proposed:

    Statistical significance of collected data to study the statistical significance of data used in our analysis. It gives strong indications about the users and if they are voters of the political event under analysis.

    Mobility flows to analyze the evolution of users’ polarization in the weeks preceding the political event. It allows to study if users maintained the same polarization or if they changed their opinion.

    Polarization prediction to predict the polarization of users before the political event. This allows understanding with what precision the polarization of a user can be predict, using information available some weeks before the vote.

The whole methodology and all its analysis have been applied to a real application case such as the Italian constitutional referendum, 2016. We studied the behavior of 50,717 Twitter users by analyzing the 338,592 tweets posted on the referendum by them in the 5 weeks preceding the vote. The results demonstrate the applicability of our methodology in discovering the behavior of social network users and how news sites are used during political campaigns.
6 Conclusions

Social media analysis is an important research area aimed at extracting useful information from the big amount of data gathered from social networks. Recent years have seen a great interest from academic and business world in using social media to measure public opinion.

This paper presents a methodology aimed at analyzing the polarization of social network users and news sites during political campaigns characterized by the rivalry of different factions. On the one hand, the methodology allows to study the users’ polarization before a political event, what arguments they used to support their voting intentions, and if such intentions change in the weeks preceding the vote. On the other hand, the methodology permits to analyze the effects of news sites on important political events, that is, how many users used information from news sites and what news sites can be considered in favor, against or neutral to a given faction.

The methodology has been validated with an important case study as the Italian constitutional referendum, 2016. According to our study, 48% of Twitter users were polarized toward no , 25% toward yes , and 27% had a neutral behavior. Regarding the change of opinion in the weeks preceding the vote, the majority of users categorized as supporters of no or yes have never changed during the weeks preceding the vote, while a consistent part of the neutral users moved toward no (20%) and toward yes (10%). A second goal was to understand the effects of news sites on the referendum campaign. The analysis has shown that some news sites had a strong polarization toward yes (unita.tv, ilsole24ore.it and linkiesta.it), some others had a neutral position (lastampa.it, corriere.it, huffingtonpost.it and repubblica.it) and others were oriented toward no (ilfattoquotidiano.it, ilgiornale.it and beppegrillo.it). The polarization of news sites has remained almost unchanged in the weeks preceding the vote.

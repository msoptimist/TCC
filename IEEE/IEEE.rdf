        <dcterms:abstract>In today&amp;#x0027;s age of instant gratification, dating apps provide the comfort of meeting new people at the swipe of a finger. However, recent high profile incidents have raised privacy-related concerns with the use of these apps. The level of harm inflicted on a victim can be either physical (e.g. murder, stalking, sexual assault) or non-physical (e.g. identity theft, harassment and cyberstalking). In this paper, we study ten popular Android dating apps. Using an adversary model, we demonstrate how one can trivially conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against these apps. We then explain how the Routine Activity Theory can be applied to design mitigation strategies for dating apps.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social networking and cloud services will collect a large number of high-dimensional and complex data for third party statistical analysis and data mining. Although data analysis is beneficial to users and external parties, they constitute a serious privacy risk disclosure of user sensitive information. First of all, the authors use Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines methods with discriminant component model to analyze the dataset of the new curriculum reform in Shaanxi Province, and make an accurate prediction of the impact on bad habits of students&amp;#x2019; comprehensive performance. Secondly, though various kinds of data transformation for privacy protection have been achieved and applied, there is little research designing two preference classification tasks simultaneously. In order to prevent the privacy leakage of sensitive information in the data analysis, the data space projection algorithm based on multiclass discriminant is used to deal with the linear and nonlinear. Clearly, the role of sensitive task and insensitive task can be exchanged. The goal is to preserve the statistical properties of one preference classification as far as possible, and to realize the data security of the other preference classification.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Online social networks have become an essential part of people's daily life, and an increasing number of users are now using multiple Online Social Networks (OSNs) for different social media services simultaneously. As a result, user's interests and preferences usually distribute in different OSNs. While most of the existing work mainly aggregates the distributed user behaviors or features directly, recently very few efforts have been focused on understanding the cross-OSN association from collective user behaviors. In this paper, we go one step further to consider the dynamic characteristic of user behaviors and propose a dynamic cross-OSN association mining framework. In this framework, dynamic user modeling is first conducted to capture the drift of user interest in each OSN. A session-based factorization method is then proposed to establish the cross-OSN association in a dynamic manner, by progressively updating the derived association each time a new session of data arrives. Based on the derived dynamic association, we finally design a cold-start YouTube video recommendation application, by only utilizing users' behaviors in Twitter. Experiments are conducted using real-world user data from Twitter and YouTube. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed framework in capturing the underlying association between different OSNs and achieving superior cold-start recommendation performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Issue tracking systems (ITSs), such as Bugzilla, are commonly used to track reported bugs, improvements and change requests for a software project. To avoid wasting developer resources on previously-reported (i.e., duplicate) issues, it is necessary to identify such duplicates as soon as they are reported. Several automated approaches have been proposed for retrieving duplicate reports, i.e., identifying the duplicate of a new issue report in a list of n candidates. These approaches rely on leveraging the textual, categorical, and contextual information in previously-reported issues to decide whether a newly-reported issue has previously been reported. In general, these approaches are evaluated using data that spans a relatively short period of time (i.e., the classical evaluation). However, in this paper, we show that the classical evaluation tends to overestimate the performance of automated approaches for retrieving duplicate issue reports. Instead, we propose a realistic evaluation using all the reports that are available in the ITS of a software project. We conduct experiments in which we evaluate two popular approaches for retrieving duplicate issues (BM25F and REP) using the classical and realistic evaluations. We find that for the issue tracking data of the Mozilla foundation, the Eclipse foundation and OpenOffice, the realistic evaluation shows that previously proposed approaches perform considerably lower than previously reported using the classical evaluation. As a result, we conclude that the reported performance of approaches for retrieving duplicate issue reports is significantly overestimated in literature. In order to improve the performance of the automated retrieval of duplicate issue reports, we propose to leverage the resolution field of issue reports. Our experiments show that a relative improvement in the performance of a median of 7-21.5% and a maximum of 19-60% can be achieved by leveraging the resolution field of issue reports for the autom- ted retrieval of duplicates.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Online reviews are extensively utilized by potential buyers to make business decisions. Unfortunately, fraudsters offer to write spam reviews for product promotion or competitor defamation, which drives online business holders to adopt this type of vicious strategy to increase their profits. These fake reviews always mislead users who shop online. Though existing anti-spam strategies have been proved to be effective in detecting traditional spam activities, evolving spam schemes can successfully cheat conventional testing by buying the comments of a massive number of random but genuine users which are sold by specific web markets, i.e., User Cloud. A more crucial problem is that such spam activities turn into a kind of 'advertising campaign' among business owners as they need to maintain their rank in the top few positions. In this paper, we propose a new Collaborative Marketing Hyping Detection solution, which aims to identify spam comments generated by the Spam Reviewer Cloud and to detect products which adopt an evolving spam strategy for promotion. Our experiments validate the existence of the Collaborative Marketing Hyping activities on a real-life e-commercial platform and also demonstrate that our model can effectively and accurately identify these advanced spam activities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>By exploring sensing, computing and communication capabilities on vehicles, Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS) are promising solutions to provide road safety and traffic efficiency in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Due to high mobility and sparse network density, VCPS could be severely affected by intermittent connectivity. In this paper, we propose a Trajectory-Driven Opportunistic Routing (TDOR) protocol, which is primarily applied for sparse networks, e.g., Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs). With geographic routing protocol designed in DTNs, existing works primarily consider the proximity to destination as a criterion for nexthop selections. Differently, by utilizing GPS information of onboard vehicle navigation system to help with data transmission, TDOR selects the relay node based on the proximity to trajectory. This aims to provide reliable and efficient message delivery, i.e., high delivery ratio and low transmission overhead. TDOR is more immune to disruptions, due to unfavorable mobility of intermediate nodes. Performance evaluation results show TDOR outperforms well known opportunistic geographic routing protocols, and achieves much lower routing overhead for comparable delivery ratio.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>During the last decade, information system designers have used the persona technique to put user needs and preferences at the center of all development decisions. Persona development teams draw on qualitative data, quantitative data or a combination of both to develop personas that are representative of the target users. Despite the benefits of both approaches, qualitative methods are limited by the cognitive capabilities of the experts, whereas quantitative methods lack contextual richness. To gain the advantages of both approaches, this article suggests a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach to create user personas based on the patterns of the affordances they actualize rather than merely the actions they take. It enriches personas by referring to the purposes fulfilled through affordance actualizations, and it grounds personas in readily available objective log data. This study illustrates the practical value of the proposed methodology by empirically creating personas based on real user data. Furthermore, it demonstrates its value by having practitioners compare the suggested method to that of qualitative-only and quantitative-only methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Transfer learning has been found helpful at enhancing the target domain&amp;#x2019;s learning process by transferring useful knowledge from other different but related source domains. In many applications, however, collecting and labeling target information is not only very difficult but also expensive. At the same time, considerable prior experience in this regard exists in other application domains. This paper proposes a feature-based transfer learning method based on distribution similarity that aims at the partial overlap of features between two domains. The non-overlapping features are completed by leveraging the distribution similarity of other features within the source domain. Features of the two domains are then reweighted in accordance with the distribution similarity between the source and target domains. This, in turn, decreases the distribution discrepancy between the two domains, thereby achieving the desired feature transfer. Results of the experiments performed on Facebook and Sina Microblog datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of effectively enhancing the accuracy of the prediction function.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The past decade has witnessed the emergence and progress of multimedia social networks (MSNs), which have explosively and tremendously increased to penetrate every corner of our lives, leisure and work. Moreover, mobile Internet and mobile terminals enable users to access to MSNs at anytime, anywhere, on behalf of any identity, including role and group. Therefore, the interaction behaviors between users and MSNs are becoming more comprehensive and complicated. This paper primarily extended and enriched the situation analytics framework for the specific social domain, named as SocialSitu, and further proposed a novel algorithm for users&amp;#x2019; intention serialization analysis based on classic Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP). We leveraged the huge volume of user behaviors records to explore the frequent sequence mode that is necessary to predict user intention. Our experiment selected two general kinds of intentions: playing and sharing of multimedia, which are the most common in MSNs, based on the intention serialization algorithm under different minimum support threshold (Min_Support). By using the users&amp;#x2019; microscopic behaviors analysis on intentions, we found that the optimal behavior patterns of each user under the Min_Support, and a user&amp;#x2019;s behavior patterns are different due to his/her identity variations in a large volume of sessions data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), an enormous amount of sensing devices collect and/or generate various sensory data over time for a wide range of fields and applications. Based on the nature of the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning techniques, namely Deep Learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges and potential directions for future research. At the end of each section, we highlight the lessons learned based on our experiments and review of the recent literature.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>DO NOT USE. EXTRA DOI - EH - In this paper we present an innovative system based on social media and high quality multimedia content delivery designed to enhance the educational experiences of students in cultural centers and museums. The system brings together students that are viewing an educational movie with a panel of experts that may be geographically dispersed, and engages them in an exciting social media experience via which they can interact with each other as well as with the remote experts. We employ appropriate methodologies for monitoring and analysing social network activity in order to extract valuable information from the social network activity and use it to seamlessly annotate in real-time the presented educational movie using anthropocentric semantic extraction based on MPEG-7. In this way, the multimedia content of the presented movie can be easily reviewed by multiple geographically dispersed individuals, and impoved afterwards according to the received feedback, thus maximising the benefit for students, teachers and content producers alike.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>An estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Using affective sensing technology, our longterm goal is to develop an objective multimodal system that augments clinical opinion during the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical depression. This paper steps towards developing a classification system-oriented approach, where feature selection, classification and fusion-based experiments are conducted to infer which types of behaviour (verbal and nonverbal) and behaviour combinations can best discriminate between depression and non-depression. Using statistical features extracted from speaking behaviour, eye activity, and head pose, we characterise the behaviour associated with major depression and examine the performance of the classification of individual modalities and when fused. Using a real-world, clinically validated dataset of 30 severely depressed patients and 30 healthy control subjects, a Support Vector Machine is used for classification with several feature selection techniques. Given the statistical nature of the extracted features, feature selection based on T-tests performed better than other methods. Individual modality classification results were considerably higher than chance level (83% for speech, 73% for eye, and 63% for head). Fusing all modalities shows a remarkable improvement compared to unimodal systems, which demonstrates the complementary nature of the modalities. Among the different fusion approaches used here, feature fusion performed best with up to 88% average accuracy. We believe that is due to the compatible nature of the extracted statistical features.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social networks are very important social cyberspaces for the human being to establish efficient relations and collaborations for life and production. Currently, information-centric networks (ICN) are main trend of next generation networks, which promote traditional social networks to information-centric social networks (IC-SN). Because of the complexity and openness of social networks, it is a very key issue to filter security services for users. However, existing scheme were proposed just for traditional social networks, which cannot satisfy the new requirements of IC-SN including extendibility, data mobility, non-IP address, flexible deployment, etc. To address this challenge, a fog computing based content-aware filtering for security services, FCSS, is proposed in information centric social networks. Firstly, the assessments and content matching scheme is proposed for IC-SN. Secondly, fog computing based content-aware filtering scheme is proposed for security services, in which the content label technology is used. The simulations and evaluations show the advantage of FCSS in terms of hit ratio, filtering delay, and filtering accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Deep learning has recently seen rapid development and received significant attention due to its state-of-the-art performance on previously-thought hard problems. However, because of the internal complexity and nonlinear structure of deep neural networks, the underlying decision making processes for why these models are achieving such performance are challenging and sometimes mystifying to interpret. As deep learning spreads across domains, it is of paramount importance that we equip users of deep learning with tools for understanding when a model works correctly, when it fails, and ultimately how to improve its performance. Standardized toolkits for building neural networks have helped democratize deep learning; visual analytics systems have now been developed to support model explanation, interpretation, debugging, and improvement. We present a survey of the role of visual analytics in deep learning research, which highlights its short yet impactful history and thoroughly summarizes the state-of-the-art using a human-centered interrogative framework, focusing on the Five W&amp;#x0027;s and How (Why, Who, What, How, When, and Where). We conclude by highlighting research directions and open research problems. This survey helps researchers and practitioners in both visual analytics and deep learning to quickly learn key aspects of this young and rapidly growing body of research, whose impact spans a diverse range of domains.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world where many of our daily objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper it is presented a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloudcentered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of authors from textual data. It extracts an author's identity and sociolinguistic characteristics based on the reflected writing styles in the text. The process is essential for various areas, such as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc. However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been shown to be scenario- or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for AA. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets. The experiments suggest that our proposed text representation outperforms the static stylometrics, dynamic n-grams, latent Dirichlet allocation, latent semantic analysis, distributed memory model of paragraph vectors, distributed bag of words version of paragraph vector, word2vec representations, and other baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recent years have witnessed an increasing need for the automated classification of sequential data, such as activities of daily living, social media interactions, financial series, and others. With the continuous flow of new data, it is critical to classify the observations on-the-fly and without being limited by a predetermined number of classes. In addition, a model should be able to update its parameters in response to a possible evolution in the distributions of the classes. This compelling problem, however, does not seem to have been adequately addressed in the literature, since most studies focus on offline classification over predefined class sets. In this paper, we present a principled solution for this problem based on an adaptive online system leveraging Markov switching models and hierarchical Dirichlet process priors. This adaptive online approach is capable of classifying the sequential data over an unlimited number of classes while meeting the memory and delay constraints typical of streaming contexts. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive 'learning rate' that is responsible for balancing the extent to which the model retains its previous parameters or adapts to new observations. Experimental results on stationary and evolving synthetic data and two video data sets, TUM Assistive Kitchen and collated Weizmann, show a remarkable performance in terms of segmentation and classification, particularly for sequences from evolutionary distributions and/or those containing previously unseen classes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Road networks are extremely vulnerable to cascading failure caused by traffic accidents or anomalous events. Therefore, accurate identification of critical nodes, whose failure may cause a dramatic reduction in the road network transmission efficiency, is of great significance to traffic management and control schemes. However, none of the existing approaches can locate city-wide critical nodes in real road networks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven framework to rank node importance through mining from comprehensive vehicle trajectory data, instead of analysis solely on the topology of the road network. In this framework, we introduce a trip network modeled by a tripartite graph to characterize the dynamics of the road network. Furthermore, we present two algorithms, integrating the origin-destination entropy with flow (ODEF) algorithm and the crossroad-rank (CRRank) algorithm, to better exploit the information included in the tripartite graph and to effectively assess the node importance. ODEF absorbs the idea of the information entropy to evaluate the centrality of a node and to calculate its importance rating by integrating its centrality with the traffic flow. CRRank is a ranking algorithm based on eigenvector centrality that captures the mutual reinforcing relationships among the OD-pair, path, and intersection. In addition to the factors considered in ODEF, CRRank considers the irreplaceability of a node and the spatial relationships between neighboring nodes. We conduct a synthetic experiment and a real case study based on a real-world dataset of taxi trajectories. Experiments verify the utility of the proposed algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Machine learning methods have been used to classify neurodegenerative diseases using gait data. Recent works with Huntington&amp;#x2019;s disease patients have reported results up to 88.2&amp;#x0025; of correct classification based on a probabilistic modeling approach for gait assessment. The aim of this work was to improve Huntington&amp;#x2019;s disease patients classification results while reducing the number of sensor devices to capture gait data and identifying the related gait features. The proposed method is based on general Assembles (Meta) Classifier algorithms approach, for the classification of Huntington&amp;#x2019;s disease affected gait versus Healthy Control subjects normal gait. The proposed methodology was tested on gait data recorded on Huntington&amp;#x2019;s disease patients and healthy control subjects using raw data from smart-phones movement sensors placed at both ankles. Best partial results of individual classifier algorithms are taken at each iteration of the meta-classifier, to predict the final result by averaging results and majority votes. Several instances of this combined approach were tested and validated. Obtained results confirm an improvement in accuracy, since 13 subjects out of a total of 14 were correctly classified. All 7 Huntington&amp;#x2019;s disease patients were correctly selected with Logitboost &amp;#x0026; RandomForest combination.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Because of severe network congestion experienced during peak hours in the urban area, dynamic time-dependent pricing has been proposed by some mobile operators to shift users&amp;#x2019; data usage from peak hours to off-peak time slots. We look at the performance of time-dependent pricing on a large scale cellular network comprising ten thousand base stations. Our investigation reveals two important observations. First, time-dependent pricing performs well in reducing the peak-average ratio of the overall traffic of the network. However, the single price used by the network does not achieve good performance when we look at base stations in specific regions, such as office regions. Second, we observe that location is another important factor that affects the traffic profile of a base station. Therefore, location information should be considered for designing a pricing strategy as well. We propose a framework that combines both spatial and temporal traffic patterns for data pricing. Our simulation on ten thousand base stations suggests that our proposed scheme is able to achieve an average of 16% smaller peak-to-average ratio. With over 15% smaller peak-to-average ratio of more than half of base stations in office regions, the performance is 2 better than that achieved by the state of the art time-dependent data pricing systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Wearable sensors are increasingly taking part of daily activities, not only because of the recent society health concern, but also due to their relevance in the medical industry. In this paper, a complete Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) technique has been developed in order to interpret electrodermal activity (EDA) records, which can be useful both for ambulatory and health applications. The core of the proposed approach is a novel feature extraction scheme that is based on a non-negative sparse deconvolution of the observed GSR signals. Unlike previous approaches, the resulting sparsEDA algorithm is fast (immediately extracting the skin conductance level and response), efficient (being able to work with any sampling rate and signal length), and highly interpretable (due to the sparsity of the extracted phasic component of the GSR). Results on real data from 100 different subjects confirm the good performance of the method, which has been released through a free web-based code repository.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Among several features used for clinical binary classification, behavioral performance, questionnaire scores, test results and physical exam reports can be counted. Attempts to include neuroimaging findings to support clinical diagnosis are scarce due to difficulties in collecting such data, as well as problems in integration of neuroimaging findings with other features. The binary classification method proposed here aims to merge small samples from multiple sites so that a large cohort which better describes the features of the disease can be built. We implemented a simple and robust framework for detection of fibromyalgia, using likelihood during decision level fusion. This framework supports sharing of classifier applications across clinical sites and arrives at a decision by fusing results from multiple classifiers. If there are missing opinions from some classifiers due to inability to collect their input features, such degradation in information is tolerated. We implemented this method using fNIRS data collected from fibromyalgia patients across three different tasks. Functional connectivity maps are derived from these tasks as features. In addition, self-reported clinical features are also used. Five classifiers are trained using kNN, LDA and SVM. Fusion of classification opinions from multiple classifiers based on log likelihood outperformed other fusion methods reported in the literature for detection of FM. When 2, 3, 4 and 5 classifers are fused, sensitivity and specificity figures of 100% could be obtained based on the choice of the classifier set.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Online stores are capable analyzing user preference from click logs and transaction records, while retailers of physical stores still lack effective methods to understand user preference. Traditional ways are predominantly field surveys, which are not effective as they need labor-intensive survey thus limit to small populations. As mobile devices and social media are becoming more and more pervasive, user-generated heterogeneous information (e.g., check-in activities and textual reviews) from these platforms are providing rich information to in-depth understand user preference. In this paper, we present a recommendation model for physical stores by learning user&amp;#x0027;s preference from user-generated heterogeneous information. Specifically, the proposed model consists of two phases: 1) offline modeling multi-relation among users, stores and aspects; 2) online graph-based recommendation. The offline modeling phase is designed to learn two kinds of relations: User-Store relation and Store-Aspect relation, while the online recommendation phase automatically produces top-k recommended stores based on the learnt relations with a graph-based model. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed model, we have performed a comprehensive experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets, which are collected by more than 120,000 users during 12 months. Experimental results show our method outperforms all baselines significantly in terms of recommendation effectiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are becoming the most promising research topic in intelligent transportation systems, because they provide information to deliver comfort and safety to both drivers and passengers. However, unique characteristics of VANETs make security, privacy, and trust management challenging issues in VANETs' design. This survey article starts with the necessary background of VANETs, followed by a brief treatment of main security services, which have been well studied in other fields. We then focus on an in-depth review of anonymous authentication schemes implemented by five pseudonymity mechanisms. Because of the predictable dynamics of vehicles, anonymity is necessary but not sufficient to thwart tracking an attack that aims at the drivers' location profiles. Thus, several location privacy protection mechanisms based on pseudonymity are elaborated to further protect the vehicles' privacy and guarantee the quality of location-based services simultaneously. We also give a comprehensive analysis on various trust management models in VANETs. Finally, considering that current and near-future applications in VANETs are evaluated by simulation, we give a much-needed update on the latest mobility and network simulators as well as the integrated simulation platforms. In sum, this paper is carefully positioned to avoid overlap with existing surveys by filling the gaps and reporting the latest advances in VANETs while keeping it self-explained.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Currently, unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in a generalized setting, which is the most common scenario in real-world applications, is under insufficient exploration. Existing approaches either are limited to special cases or require labeled target samples for training. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a generalized framework, named as transfer independently together (TIT). Specifically, we learn multiple transformations, one for each domain (independently), to map data onto a shared latent space, where the domains are well aligned. The multiple transformations are jointly optimized in a unified framework (together) by an effective formulation. In addition, to learn robust transformations, we further propose a novel landmark selection algorithm to reweight samples, i.e., increase the weight of pivot samples and decrease the weight of outliers. Our landmark selection is based on graph optimization. It focuses on sample geometric relationship rather than sample features. As a result, by abstracting feature vectors to graph vertices, only a simple and fast integer arithmetic is involved in our algorithm instead of matrix operations with float point arithmetic in existing approaches. At last, we effectively optimize our objective via a dimensionality reduction procedure. TIT is applicable to arbitrary sample dimensionality and does not need labeled target samples for training. Extensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks and large-scale datasets of image classification, text categorization and text-to-image recognition verify the superiority of our approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Person reidentification (re-id), as an important task in video surveillance and forensics applications, has been widely studied. Previous research efforts toward solving the person re-id problem have primarily focused on constructing robust vector description by exploiting appearance's characteristic, or learning discriminative distance metric by labeled vectors. Based on the cognition and identification process of human, we propose a new pattern, which transforms the feature description from characteristic vector to discrepancy matrix. In particular, in order to well identify a person, it converts the distance metric from vector metric to matrix metric, which consists of the intradiscrepancy projection and interdiscrepancy projection parts. We introduce a consistent term and a discriminative term to form the objective function. To solve it efficiently, we utilize a simple gradient-descent method under the alternating optimization process with respect to the two projections. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pattern as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>More massive volume of data are generated in many areas than ever before. However, the missing of some values in collected data always occurs in practice and challenges extracting maximal value from these large scale data sets. Nevertheless, in multivariable time series, most of the existing methods either might be infeasible or could be inefficient to predict the missing data. In this paper, we have taken up the challenge of missing data prediction in multivariable time series by employing improved matrix factorization techniques. Our approaches are optimally designed to largely utilize both the internal patterns of each time series and the information of time series across multiple sources. Based on the idea, we have imposed three different regularization terms to constrain the objective functions of matrix factorization and built five corresponding models. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets and synthetic data set demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively improve the performance of missing data prediction in multivariable time series. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated how to take advantage of the high processing power of Apache Spark to perform missing data prediction in large scale multivariable time series.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we present a novel method to predict long-term popularity of User Generated Content (UGC). At first, the method clusters the dynamics of UGC popularity into a vocabulary of growth in popularity (sequence) by using a mixture model. Eventually, the method assigns to each sequence a topic model to describe the dynamics of the sequence in a compact way. We then use this topic model to identify similar patterns of growth in popularity of newly observed UGC. The proposed method has two key features: 1) it considers the historical dynamics of the UGC popularity, and 2) it provides long-term popularity prediction. Results on real dataset of UGC show that the proposed method is flexible, and able to accurately forecast the complete growth in popularity of a given UGC.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recently exploring locally connected subgraphs (also known as motifs or graphlets) of complex networks attracts a lot of attention. Previous work made the strong assumption that the graph topology of interest is known in advance. In practice, sometimes researchers have to deal with the situation where the graph topology is unknown because it is expensive to collect and store all topological information. Hence, typically what is available to researchers is only a snapshot of the graph, i.e., a subgraph of the graph. Crawling methods such as breadth first sampling can be used to generate the snapshot. However, these methods fail to sample a streaming graph represented as a high speed stream of edges. Therefore, graph mining applications such as network traffic monitoring usually use random edge sampling (i.e., sample each edge with a fixed probability) to collect edges and generate a sampled graph, which we call a &amp;#x201C;RESampled graph&amp;#x201D;. Clearly, a RESampled graph&amp;#x2019;s motif statistics may be quite different from those of the original graph. To resolve this, we propose a framework Minfer, which takes the given RESampled graph and accurately infers the underlying graph&amp;#x2019;s motif statistics. Experiments using large scale datasets show the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>As a fundamental step in various data analysis, exemplar-based clustering aims at clustering data by identifying representative samples as exemplars of the obtained groups. In this paper, a new fast exemplar-based clustering approach is proposed for a dataset with an arbitrary shape and number of clusters. The proposed approach begins with the reduced set of a dataset, which is a condensation of the dataset obtained by the well-developed kernel density estimators reduced set density estimator or fast reduced set density estimator, and then enters into its two advantageous stages: 1) fast exemplar finding (FEF) and 2) fast cluster assignment. The idea of the proposed approach has its basis in three assumptions: 1) exemplars should come from high-density samples; 2) exemplars should be either the components of the reduced set or their neighbors with high similarities; and 3) clusters can be diffused by surrounding both exemplars and its labeled reduced set. We theoretically analyze the proposed FEF from the perspective of the generalization performance of clustering and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on several benchmarking datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Deep learning, e.g., convolutional neural networks(CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), has achieved great success in image processing and natural language processing especially in high level vision applications such as recognition and understanding. However, it is rarely used to solve information security problems such as attack detection studied in this paper. Here, we move forward a step and propose a novel multi-channel intelligent attack detection method based on LSTM-RNNs. To achieve high accurate detection rate, data preprocessing, feature abstraction and multi-channel training and detection is seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end detection method. Data preprocessing provides high-quality data for subsequent processing, then different type of feature is extracted from the processed data as vector. Multi-channel processing is used to generate classifiers based on training neural network with different type of feature, which preserve attack feature of input vectors and classify the attack from normal data. With the result of the classifier&amp;#x0027;s attack detection, we introduce a voting algorithm to decide whether the input data is an attack or not. Experimental results validate that the proposed attack detection method greatly outperforms several attack detection methods that use feature detection, Bayesian or SVM methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Billions of user images, which are shared on social media, can be widely accessible by others due to their sharing nature. Using machine-generated labels to annotate those images is a reliable for user connections discovery on social networks. The machine-generated labels are obtained from encoded vectors using up-to-date image processing and computer vision techniques, such as convolution neural network. By analyzing 2 million user-shared images from 8 online social networks, a phenomenon is observed that the distribution of user similarity based on their shared images follows exponential functions. Users who share visually similar images are likely having follower/followee relationships, regardless of the origins and the content sharing mechanisms of a social network. This phenomenon is nicely formulated for a multimedia big data recommendation engine as an alternative to social graphs for recommendation. By utilizing the formulation of the distribution, it is proven the proposed engine can be 46% better than previous approaches in F1 score and achieves a comparable performance of friends-of-friends approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in related fields to characterize such phenomenon by massive user-shared images collected from real-world SNs, and then formulate into practical analytics engine for connection discovery.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are a challenging IoT scenario. While research is proposing increasingly sophisticated hardware and software solutions for on-board context detection, probably high-level context information sharing has not been adequately addressed so far. This paper proposes a novel logic-based framework enabling a contextual data management and mining in VANETs. It grounds on a knowledge fusion algorithm based on non-standard, non-monotonic inference services in Description Logics, adopting standard Semantic Web languages. Ontology-referred context annotations produced by individual VANET nodes are merged with automatic reconciliation of inconsistencies. An efficient information dissemination protocol complements the proposal. The approach has been implemented in a vehicular network simulator and early experimental results proved its effectiveness and feasibility.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Detecting events from massive social media data in social networks can facilitate browsing, search, and monitoring of real-time events by corporations, governments, and users. The short, conversational, heterogeneous, and real-time characteristics of social media data bring great challenges for event detection. The existing event detection approaches rely mainly on textual information, while the visual content of microblogs and the intrinsic correlation among the heterogeneous data are scarcely explored. To deal with the above challenges, we propose a novel real-time event detection method by generating an intermediate semantic level from social multimedia data, named microblog clique (MC), which is able to explore the high correlations among different microblogs. Specifically, the proposed method comprises three stages. First, the heterogeneous data in microblogs is formulated in a hypergraph structure. Hypergraph cut is conducted to group the highly correlated microblogs with the same topics as the MCs, which can address the information inadequateness and data sparseness issues. Second, a bipartite graph is constructed based on the generated MCs and the transfer cut partition is performed to detect the events. Finally, for new incoming microblogs, incremental hypergraph is constructed based on the latest MCs to generate new MCs, which are classified by bipartite graph partition into existing events or new ones. Extensive experiments are conducted on the events in the Brand-Social-Net dataset and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The vehicle location prediction based on their spatial and temporal information is an important and difficult task in many applications. In the last few years, devices, such as connected vehicles, smart phones, GPS navigation systems, and smart home appliances, have amassed the large stores of geographic data. The task of leveraging this data by employing moving objects database techniques to predict spatio-temporal locations in an accurate and efficient fashion, comprising a complete trajectory remains an actively researched area. Existing methods for frequent sequential pattern mining tend to be limited to predicting short-term partial trajectories, at extremely high computational costs. In order to address these limitations, we designed a prefix-projection-based trajectory prediction algorithm called PrefixTP, which contains three essential phases. First, data collection, connected vehicles equipped with sensors comprise a vehicle grid and generate copious amounts of spatio-temporal data, in order to communicate and share traffic information. Second, model training, examining only the prefix subsequences, and projecting only their corresponding postfix subsequences into projected sets. Finally, trajectory matching, recursively finding postfix sequences meeting the requirement of minimum support count, and outputting the most frequent sequential pattern as the most probable trajectory. Fundamentally, PrefixTP supports three trajectory matching strategies which encompass all possibilities of prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted using real world GPS data sets, and the results show, when comparing predicted complete trajectories against partial short-term trajectories with a guarantee of real-time forecasting, that PrefixTP outperforms first-order, second-order Markov models, and Apriori-based trajectory prediction algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Ten years ago, Go playing was stated as a challenge for AI researchers with an agenda of looking at pattern-recognition and temporal reasoning, as well as game-playing in general. With the success of Go playing programs, it is clear great strides have been made in these areas. In language and broad reasoning, the Watson program was able to beat human experts in Jeopardy! In this article we look at some of the successes of current cognitive architectures on these games. We then explore new challenges in games that will require pushing new agendas in cognitive computing, particularly using Dungeons and Dragons (TM) as an example.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A discrete-time dynamical opinion network is considered in which individuals express their opinions, modeled by scalars, about a certain subject. The reputation (rating) of the subject, herein also referred to as the public opinion, is defined as the arithmetic mean of the expressed opinions. It is assumed that the expressed opinion of an individual may differ from her actual belief due to two main opposing social behaviors, namely conformity and manipulation. For the purposes of this paper, conformity refers to the tendency of an individual to express an opinion that matches the public opinion, whereas manipulation refers to the tendency of an individual to express an opinion so as to manipulate the public opinion toward her actual belief. The general goal is to investigate how the public opinion evolves in the presence of these behaviors via a game-theoretic approach. Several single- and multi-stage games are introduced to address different relevant scenarios. In all games, the actual beliefs are modeled by scalars in the interval [0, 1]. However, the games are organized into two classes, according to the nature of the expressed opinions that represent the pl</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The popularity of mobile applications has greatly enriched and facilitated our life. However, the rapid increase of digital images and the problem of narrow bandwidth of the wireless network call for an appropriate approach to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the wireless network (i.e., low bit-rate transmission) while ensuring high recognition accuracy at the cloud. We propose a simple and effective feature retargeting (FR) approach for retargeting an image while preserving the representative local features (e.g., SIFT, SURF, BRIEF) in the image. Our feature retargeting approach aims at low bit-rate visual recognition instead of high quality visual perception that visual retargeting methods dedicate to. Our algorithm consists of two key novelties: estimating feature saliency and retargeting image. Estimating feature saliency focuses on predicting the relative importance of different features in an image by analyzing uniqueness in a specific context; retargeting image aims at finding the optimal resolution for the retargeted image to maximize feature-saliency energy. We evaluate the proposed approach for two different applications in three large datasets and observe that our FR approach consistently outperforms state-of-theart retargeting algorithms, resulting in both higher precision and lower bit-rates. We also demonstrate that even when the resolution of source image is reduced greatly, e.g., 1/7 original size, our algorithm produces superior results as compared to other approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Management of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is a key aspect of product manufacturing. The fierce industry competition and numerous regulations (guidelines) make EMC architects, engineers, and manufacturers increasingly anxious to apply EMC management in each phase (design, validation, development, production, deployment, and monitoring) by depending mainly on their experience. To organize the knowledge, regulations, and implementations of EMC management, this study introduces a new knowledge base with a collection of entities, their properties, and a rich set of relationships among them. Then, a machine learning-based framework for EMC management automation and intelligence is proposed. Convolutional neural network is applied to establish and classify the entities, and the knowledge-based question-answering approach is used for question answering. Finally, the EMC management plan is generated automatically. Two experiments were designed to evaluate the proposed method, and results show that both good recall and precision are achieved in the comprehensive EMC management scenarios. This method is useful for the practical EMC management of industrial products and can enhance product quality, shorten the production cycle, and reduce production cost.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social networks are known to be vulnerable to Sybil attack, in which an attacker maintains massive Sybils to perform various malicious activities. Therefore, Sybil detection in social networks is a fundamental security research problem. Structure-based methods have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils. Existing structure-based methods can be classified into Random Walk (RW)-based methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based methods cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which limits their detection accuracy, and they are not robust to noisy labels. LBP-based methods are not scalable, and cannot guarantee convergence. We propose SybilSCAR, a novel structure-based method to perform Sybil detection in social networks. SybilSCAR maintains the advantages of existing methods while overcoming their limitations. Specifically, SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust to label noises. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based methods. Under our framework, these methods can be viewed as iteratively applying a local rule to every user, which propagates label information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which SybilSCAR iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We perform both theoretical and empirical evaluations to compare SybilSCAR with state-of-the-art RW-based and LBP-based methods</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Smart grid (SG) is an integration of traditional power grid with advanced information and communication infrastructure for bidirectional energy flow between grid and end users. A huge amount of data is being generated by various smart devices deployed in SG systems. Such a massive data generation from various smart devices in SG systems may generate issues such as-congestion, and available bandwidth on the networking infrastructure deployed between users and the grid. Hence, an efficient data transmission technique is required for providing desired QoS to the end users in this environment. Generally, the data generated by smart devices in SG has high dimensions in the form of multiple heterogeneous attributes, values of which are changed with time. The high dimensions of data may affect the performance of most of the designed solutions in this environment. Most of the existing schemes reported in the literature have complex operations for data dimensionality reduction problem which may deteriorate the performance of any implemented solution for this problem. To address these challenges, in this paper, a tensor-based big data management scheme is proposed for dimensionality reduction problem of big data generated from various smart devices. In the proposed scheme, firstly the Frobenius</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Travel behavior understanding is a long-standing and critically important topic in the area of smart cities. Big volumes of various GPS-based travel data can be easily collected, among which the taxi GPS trajectory data is a typical example. However, in GPS trajectory data, there is usually little information on travelers' activities, thereby they can only support limited applications. Quite a few studies have been focused on enriching the semantic meaning for raw data, such as travel mode/purpose inferring. Unfortunately, trip purpose imputation receives relatively less attention and requires no real-time response. To narrow the gap, we propose a probabilistic two-phase framework named TripImputor, for making the real-time taxi trip purpose imputation and recommending services to passengers at their dropoff points. Specifically, in the first phase, we propose a two-stage clustering algorithm to identify candidate activity areas (CAAs) in the urban space. Then, we extract fine-granularity spatial and temporal patterns of human behaviors inside the CAAs from foursquare check-in data to approximate the priori probability for each activity, and compute the posterior probabilities (i.e., infer the trip purposes) using Bayes' theorem. In the second phase, we take a sophisticated procedure that clusters historical dropoff points and matches the dropoff clusters and CAAs to immerse the real-time response. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed two-phase framework using real-world data sets, which consist of road network, check-in data generated by over 38,000 users in one year, and the large-scale taxi trip data generated by over 19,000 taxis in a month in Manhattan, the New York City, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that the system is able to infer the trip purpose accurately, and can provide recommendation results to passengers within 1.6 s in Manhattan on average, just using a single normal PC.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>City-scale events attract large amounts of attendees in temporarily re-purposed urban environments. In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in &amp;#x2013; or moving through &amp;#x2013; the event terrain is central to applications such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g. sensor networks, mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees&amp;#x2019; behaviour during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose 3 classes of density estimation strategies, i.e. geo-based, speed-based and flow-based strategy, inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of 5 days and 1 day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, a- d limited mean errors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The use of scatterplots is an important method for multivariate data visualization. The point distribution on the scatterplot, along with variable values represented by each point, can help analyze underlying patterns in data. However, determining the multivariate data variation on a scatterplot generated using projection methods, such as multidimensional scaling, is difficult. Furthermore, the point distribution becomes unclear when the data scale is large and clutter problems occur. These conditions can significantly decrease the usability of scatterplots on multivariate data analysis. In this study, we present a cluster-based visual abstraction method to enhance the visualization of multivariate scatterplots. Our method leverages an adapted multilabel clustering method to provide abstractions of high quality for scatterplots. An image-based method is used to deal with large scale data problem. Furthermore, a suite of glyphs is designed to visualize the data at different levels of detail and support data exploration. The view coordination between the glyph-based visualization and the table lens can effectively enhance the multivariate data analysis. Through numerical evaluations for data abstraction quality, case studies and a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed techniques for multivariate data analysis on scatterplots.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Releasing social network data could seriously breach user privacy. User profile and friendship relations are inherently private. Unfortunately, it is possible to predict sensitive information carried in released data latently by utilizing data mining techniques. Therefore, sanitizing network data prior to release is necessary. In this paper, we explore how to launch an inference attack exploiting social networks with a mixture of non-sensitive attributes and social relationships. We map this issue to a collective classification problem and propose a collective inference model. In our model, an attacker utilizes user profile and social relationships in a collective manner to predict sensitive information of related victims in a released social network dataset. To protect against such attacks, we propose a data sanitization method collectively manipulating user profile and friendship relations. The key novel idea lies that besides sanitizing friendship relations, the proposed method can take advantages of various data-manipulating methods. We show that we can easily reduce adversary&amp;#x2019;s prediction accuracy on sensitive information, while resulting in less accuracy decrease on non-sensitive information towards three social network datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs collective methods involving various data-manipulating methods and social relationships to protect against inference attacks in social networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cross-modal metric learning (CML) deals with learning distance functions for cross-modal data matching. The existing methods mostly focus on minimizing a loss defined on sample pairs. However, the numbers of intraclass and interclass sample pairs can be highly imbalanced in many applications, and this can lead to deteriorating or unsatisfactory performances. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a more meaningful performance measure for the imbalanced distribution problem. To tackle the problem as well as to make samples from different modalities directly comparable, a CML method is presented by directly maximizing AUC. The method can be further extended to focus on optimizing partial AUC (pAUC), which is the AUC between two specific false positive rates (FPRs). This is particularly useful in certain applications where only the performances assessed within predefined false positive ranges are critical. The proposed method is formulated as a log-determinant regularized semidefinite optimization problem. For efficient optimization, a minibatch proximal point algorithm is developed. The algorithm is experimentally verified stable with the size of sampled pairs that form a minibatch at each iteration. Several data sets have been used in evaluation, including three cross-modal data sets on face recognition under various scenarios and a single modal data set, the Labeled Faces in the Wild. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and marked improvements over the existing methods. Specifically, pAUC-optimized CML proves to be more competitive for performance measures such as Rank-1 and verification rate at FPR = 0.1&amp;#x0025;.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Embedding network data into a low-dimensional vector space has shown promising performance for many real-world applications, such as node classification and entity retrieval. However, most existing methods focused only on leveraging network structure. For social networks, besides the network structure, there also exists rich information about social actors, such as user profiles of friendship networks and textual content of citation networks. These rich attribute information of social actors reveal the homophily effect, exerting huge impacts on the formation of social networks. In this paper, we explore the rich evidence source of attributes in social networks to improve network embedding. We propose a generic Attributed Social Network Embedding framework (ASNE), which learns representations for social actors (i.e., nodes) by preserving both the structural proximity and attribute proximity. While the structural proximity captures the global network structure, the attribute proximity accounts for the homophily effect. To justify our proposal, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, ASNE can learn more informative representations, achieving substantial gains on the tasks of link prediction and node classification. Specifically, ASNE significantly outperforms node2vec with an 8.2% relative improvement on the link prediction task, and a 12.7% gain on the node classification task.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Having great managers is as critical to success as having a good team or organization. In general, a great manager is seen as fuelling the team they manage, enabling it to use its full potential. Though software engineering research studies factors that may affect the performance and productivity of software engineers and teams (like tools and skill), it has overlooked the software engineering manager. The software industry&amp;#x0027;s growth and change in the last decades is creating a need for a domain-specific view of management. On the one hand, experts are questioning how the abundant work in management applies to software engineering. On the other hand, practitioners are looking to researchers for evidence-based guidance on how to manage software teams. We conducted a mixed methods empirical study of software engineering management at Microsoft to investigate what manager attributes developers and engineering managers perceive important and why. We present a conceptual framework of manager attributes, and find that technical skills are not the sign of greatness for an engineering manager. Through statistical analysis we identify how engineers and managers relate in their views, and how software engineering differs from other knowledge work groups in its perceptions about what makes great managers. We present strategies for putting the attributes to use, discuss implications for research and practice, and offer avenues for further work.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vehicular networks have the potential to improve road safety using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology, but substantial investment in roadside units (RSUs) is required. DSRC can be simultaneously used for safety and non-safety applications. If local governments share RSUs deployed for safety or smart streetlights with other kinds of service providers, then the respective costs can also be shared, thereby reducing costs for the government. We estimate that government could save about one-fifth of the nationwide cost of safety RSUs in the U.S. if they are shared with Internet service providers. We also estimate an increase in social welfare from sharing safety RSUs. In the case of sharing smart streetlights, we find that nationwide benefits could be up to one-third higher than with sharing of safety RSUs. The prices that maximize government savings and social welfare may differ. However, we find that maximizing government savings results in near-optimal social welfare. The benefits of sharing would increase significantly if the Internet traffic or DSRC penetration grow over time, as expected.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>What is the growth dynamics of social networks, like Facebook or WeChat Does it truly exhibit exponential early-growth, as predicted by the celebrated models, like the Bass model How about the dynamics of links, for which there are few published models For the first time, we examine the growth of WeChat which is the largest online social network in China, together with several other real social networks. We observe Power-Law growth dynamics for both nodes and links, a fact that breaks the textbook models featuring Sigmoid curves. We propose NetTide, along with differential equations for the growth of nodes and links. Our model fits the growth dynamics of real social networks well; it encompasses many traditional growth dynamics as special cases; while remaining parsimonious in parameters. The NetTide for link growth is the first one of its kind, accurately fitting real data, and capturing densification phenomenon. We further formulate two stochastic generators, which interpret the growth of nodes and links through survival analysis and micro-level interactions within a social network respectively. The proposed generators reproduce realistic growth dynamics of social networks. When applied on the WeChat data, our NetTide forecasted &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$ge$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; 730 days ahead with 3&amp;#x0025; error.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In order to retrieve unlabeled images by textual queries, cross-media similarity computation is a key ingredient. Although novel methods are continuously introduced, little has been done to evaluate these methods together with large-scale query log analysis. Consequently, how far have these methods brought us in answering real-user queries is unclear. Given baseline methods that use relatively simple text/image matching, how much progress have advanced models made is also unclear. This paper takes a pragmatic approach to answering the two questions. Queries are automatically categorized according to the proposed query visualness measure, and later connected to the evaluation of multiple cross-media similarity models on three test sets. Such a connection reveals that the success of the state-of-the-art is mainly attributed to their good performance on visual-oriented queries, which account for only a small part of real-user queries.To quantify the current progress, we propose a simple text2image method, representing a novel query by a set of images selected from large-scale query log. Consequently, computing cross-media similarity between the query and a given image boils down to comparing the visual similarity between the given image and the selected images. Image retrieval experiments on the challenging Clickture dataset show that the proposed text2image is a strong baseline, comparing favorably to recent deep learning alternatives.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Contribution: This paper provides evidence of the lack of gender diversity at audio engineering conferences, using a novel and inclusive gender determination method to produce a new dataset of author gender. Background: Audio engineering has historically been male-dominated; while the number of non-male audio engineers has increased recently, the industry mindset has changed very little. Studies into the gender diversity of this field are required, to force a shift in mindset and create a more inclusive environment. Research Questions: To what extent is there an imbalance in the representation of different genders at audio engineering conferences? Do conference topic, presentation type, or author position have an impact on the gender balance? Methodology: A novel method was designed to obtain pronouns of authors where possible, avoiding removal of data or potential false positives. The main limitation of this methodology is the time required for gender determination. Gender composition was analyzed across 20 conferences, with gender balance further analyzed within four key categories: 1) conference topic; 2) presentation type; 3) position in the author byline; and 4) the number of authors. Findings: This paper demonstrates a clear lack of gender diversity in conference authorship in audio engineering. The results show low overall representation of non-male authors at audio engineering conferences, with significant differences across conference topics, and a notable lack of gender diversity within invited presentations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Defect prediction models---classifiers that identify defect-prone software modules---have configurable parameters that control their characteristics (e.g., the number of trees in a random forest). Recent studies show that these classifiers underperform when default settings are used. In this paper, we study the impact of automated parameter optimization on defect prediction models. Through a case study of 18 datasets, we find that automated parameter optimization: (1) improves AUC performance by up to 40 percentage points; (2) yields classifiers that are at least as stable as those trained using default settings; (3) substantially shifts the importance ranking of variables, with as few as 28% of the top-ranked variables in optimized classifiers also being top-ranked in non-optimized classifiers; (4) yields optimized settings for 17 of the 20 most sensitive parameters that transfer among datasets without a statistically significant drop in performance; and (5) adds less than 30 minutes of additional computation to 12 of the 26 studied classification techniques. While widely-used classification techniques like random forest and support vector machines are not optimization-sensitive, traditionally overlooked techniques like C5.0 and neural networks can actually outperform widely-used techniques after optimization is applied. This highlights the importance of exploring the parameter space when using parameter-sensitive classification techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile edge/fog computing is a network architecture that brings the functionality of conventional centralized cloud to the edge nodes which are in close proximity of the end devices in internet of things (IoT) network. Fog networks have many advantages over traditional cloud networks, such as increased bandwidth utilization, enhanced security and privacy, better energy efficiency, improved performance and support for mobility. The most critical requirement of a fog architecture is to minimize the end to end latency in IoT networks, particularly in scenarios where large number of end devices (IoT nodes) and distributed computing fog nodes (cloudlets) are present. In this article, we formulated an optimization problem for joint cloudlet selection and latency minimization in fog network, subject to maximum work load and latency constraints. The problem can be epitomized as many-to-one matching game in which IoT nodes and cloudlets rank each other in order to minimize the latency. The proposed game belongs to a class of matching games with externalities. We propose an algorithm to solve this game which gives distributed and self-organizing solution. Extensive simulations have been carried out to validate the proposed algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Driven by the increasing popularity of the microservice architecture, we see an increase in services with unknown demand pattern located in the edge network. Pre-deployed instances of such services would be idle most of the time, which is economically infeasible. Also, the finite storage capacity limits the amount of deployed instances we can offer. Instead, we present an on-demand deployment scheme using the Docker platform. In Docker, service images consist of layers, each layer adding specific functionality. This allows different services to reuse layers, avoiding cluttering the storages with redundant replicas. We propose a layer placement method which allows users to connect to a server, retrieve all necessary layers -possibly from multiple locations-and deploy an instance of the requested service within the desired response time. We search for the best layer placement which maximizes the satisfied demand given the storage and delay constraints. We developed an iterative optimization heuristic which is less exhaustive by dividing the global problem in smaller subproblems. Our simulation results show that our heuristic is able to solve the problem with less system resources. Last, we present interesting use-cases to use this approach in real-life scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Object detection plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems and intelligent vehicles. Although the topic of object detection has been studied for decades, it is still challenging to accurately detect objects under complex scenarios. The contributing factors for challenges include diversified object and background appearance, motion blur, adverse weather conditions, and complex interactions among objects. In this paper, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model for traffic object detection, by using multi-scale local and global feature representation (MFR). The proposed model consists of two components: a region proposal network that generates candidate object regions and an object detection network that incorporates multi-scale features and global information, namely MFR-CNN. These two components are jointly optimized. Once the system is trained, it can detect real-world traffic objects accurately, especially small objects and heavily occluded objects. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets, achieving consistent improvements over the state of the art.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Scalable data processing platforms built on cloud computing becomes increasingly attractive as infrastructure for supporting big data applications. But privacy concerns are one of the major obstacles to making use of public cloud platforms. Multidimensional anonymisation, a global-recoding generalisation scheme for privacy-preserving data publishing, has been a recent focus due to its capability of balancing data obfuscation and usability. Existing multidimensional anonymisation methods suffer from scalability problems when handling big data due to the impractical serial I/O cost. Given the recursive feature of multidimensional anonymisation, parallelisation is an ideal solution to scalability issues. However, it is still a challenge to use existing distributed and parallel paradigms directly for recursive computation. In this paper, we propose a scalable approach for big data multidimensional anonymisation based on MapReduce, a state-of-the-art data processing paradigm. Our basic idea is to partition a data set recursively into smaller partitions using MapReduce until all partitions can fit in the memory of a computing node. A tree indexing structure is proposed to achieve recursive computation. Moreover, we show the applicability of our approach to differential privacy. Experimental results on real-life data demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the scalability of multidimensional anonymisation over existing methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Fuzzy associative classification has not been widely analyzed in the literature, although associative classifiers (ACs) have proved to be very effective in different real domain applications. The main reason is that learning fuzzy ACs is a very heavy task, especially when dealing with large datasets. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose an efficient distributed fuzzy associative classification approach based on the MapReduce paradigm. The approach exploits a novel distributed discretizer based on fuzzy entropy for efficiently generating fuzzy partitions of the attributes. Then, a set of candidate fuzzy association rules is generated by employing a distributed fuzzy extension of the well-known FP-Growth algorithm. Finally, this set is pruned by using three purposely adapted types of pruning. We implemented our approach on the popular Hadoop framework. Hadoop allows distributing storage and processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. We have performed an extensive experimentation and a detailed analysis of the results using six very large datasets with up to 11,000,000 instances. We have also experimented different types of reasoning methods. Focusing on accuracy, model complexity, computation time, and scalability, we compare the results achieved by our approach with those obtained by two distributed nonfuzzy ACs recently proposed in the literature. We highlight that, although the accuracies result to be comparable, the complexity, evaluated in terms of number of rules, of the classifiers generated by the fuzzy distributed approach is lower than the one of the nonfuzzy classifiers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Automatic assessment of sentiment from visual content has gained considerable attention with the increasing tendency of expressing opinions via images and videos online. This paper investigates the problem of visual sentiment analysis, which involves a high-level abstraction in the recognition process. While most of the current works focus on improving holistic representations, we aim to utilize the local information, which is inspired by the observation that both the whole image and local regions convey significant sentiment information. We propose a framework to leverage affective regions, where we first use an off-the-shelf objectness tool to generate some candidates as input, and employ a candidate selection method to remove redundant and noisy proposals. Then a convolutional neural network (CNN) is connected with each candidate to compute the sentiment scores, and the affective regions are automatically discovered taking the objectness score as well as the sentiment score into consideration. Finally, the CNN outputs from local regions are aggregated with the whole images to produce the final predictions. Our framework only requires image-level labels, thereby significantly reducing the annotation burden otherwise required for training. This is especially important for sentiment analysis as sentiment can be abstract, and labeling affective regions is too subjective and labor-consuming. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on eight popular benchmark datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper studies the composition in portrait paintings and develops an algorithm to improve the composition of portrait photographs based on example portrait paintings. A study of portrait paintings shows that the placement of the face and the figure is pose-related. Based on this observation, this paper develops an algorithm to improve the composition of a portrait photograph by learning the placement of the face and the figure from an example portrait painting. This example portrait painting is selected based on the similarity of its figure pose to that of the input photograph. This similarity measure is modeled as a graph matching problem. Finally, space cropping is performed using an optimization function to assign a similar location for each body part of the figure in the photograph with that of the figure in the example portrait painting. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A user study shows that the proposed pose-based composition improvement is preferred more than rule-based methods and learning-based methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Bonferroni mean aggregates the interaction between all pairs of inputs from some n-dimensional input vector. Therefore it is able to capture the dependency structure between the inputs. Weighted version of the Bonferroni mean then assumes that each input has a possibly different weight. Such an approach poses several constraints that decrease the modelling flexibility of the dependency structure on the input space. In this paper we present an overview of the different approaches to weighted Bonferroni mean and introduce the Bonferroni mean with weighted interaction where interactions between inputs are weighted rather than the inputs themselves. We show several important properties of the Bonferroni mean with weighted interaction and its connection to concepts studied before. Finally, using the described approach we design a system for emergency management that is able to raise an alarm in the case where certain criteria are met.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>DISboards is a discussion forum that provides a platform for knowledge sharing on planning and resources for Disney-related travel. Since no previous work has been devoted to studying the online social networks (SNs) in the forums, we examine the SN and knowledge sharing activities in DISboards as a case study of discussion forums. Based on a large amount of data collected, we provide an in-depth study of DISboards. In particular, we analyzed SN structure, effect of SN in the forum, category characteristics and so on. We found that users with more friends are generally more active in the forum; teens are more active and constitute a significant part of the SN. We clustered the selected categories into three groups: report, fact, discussion, and characterized their properties. Most users focus narrowly on only a few categories, while very few users participate in many categories. The development of SN should be able to attract more users to involve in the forum. We believe that the results presented in this paper are crucial in understanding SN and knowledge sharing in the forums. The paper also gives an instruction for the enhancement of SNs to incentivize users&amp;#x0027; activeness in the forums.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Multi-tier networks have many applications in different fields. We define a novel two-tier quantizer that can be applied to different node deployment problems including the energy conservation in two-tier wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consisting of N access points (APs) and M fusion centers (FCs). We aim at finding an optimal deployment of APs and FCs to minimize the average weighted total, or Lagrangian, of sensor and AP powers. For one fusion center, M &amp;#x0003D; 1, we show that the optimal deployment of APs is simply a linear transformation of the optimal N-level quantizer for density f, and the sole FC should be located at the geometric centroid of the sensing field. We also provide the exact expression of the AP-Sensor power function and prove its convexity. For more than one fusion center, M &amp;#x003E; 1, we provide a necessary condition for the optimal deployment. Furthermore, to numerically optimize the AP and FC deployment, we propose three Lloyd-like algorithms and analyze their convergence. Simulation results show that our algorithms outperform the existing algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Contribution: This paper contributes to the literature by confirming the existence, in gender and socio-economic diversified higher educational environments, of differential evaluation ratings given by students to their teachers. Background: Women and low socio-economic classes have historically been under-represented, both as students and teachers. Various policies and measures are being put in place internationally to raise their standing, equity, and success as they progress in their careers. To be effective, the after effects of these policies must be investigated and understood. Research Questions: This paper addressed the question of whether gender and socio-economic differences, in both teachers and students, affect students' opinion of their teachers in higher education, across a number of disciplines. Methodology: The research analyzed the differentials in students' ratings of their teachers in five disciplines in the field of education. Data was drawn from student responses to the surveys conducted in a large Indian university at the end of each course unit. The survey questions elicit their perceptions of teaching quality in the disciplines of civil engineering, electrical engineering, computer science engineering, mathematics, humanities and social sciences. This paper analyzes 112 919 and 16 354 complete sets of student ratings, to study the gender and socio-economic diversity based effects respectively. Statistical multivariate and univariate general linear models were used to derive the relevant results and graphs. Findings: The study reveals the existence of socio-economic status bias, gender-typical behavior, gender-atypical behavior, and same-gender and cross-gender biases; these resulted in differential ratings in the disciplines examined.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a new image hashing that is designed with tensor decomposition (TD), referred to TD hashing, where image hash generation is viewed as deriving a compact representation from a tensor. Specifically, a stable three-order tensor is first constructed from the normalized image, so as to enhance the robustness of our TD hashing. A popular TD algorithm, called Tucker decomposition, is then exploited to decompose the three-order tensor into a core tensor and three orthogonal factor matrices. As the factor matrices can reflect intrinsic structure of original tensor, hash construction with the factor matrices makes a desirable discrimination of the TD hashing. To examine these claims, there are 14551 images selected for our experiments. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graph is used to conduct theoretical analysis and the ROC comparisons illustrate that the TD hashing outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms in classification performance between the robustness and discrimination.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is an evolutionary paradigm seamlessly integrating an enormous number of smart objects within the Internet. Recently, with the rapid growth and universality of wearable technology, novel security threats are emerging at the system level as well as at edge nodes in IoT-based networks. In this study, we envision a future IoT scenario in which end-users are with smart wearable objects related to human brainwave retrieval. A novel transparent authentication system using brainwaves as bio-features for IoT-based networks is proposed. In brief, this study firstly provides a comprehensive review of transparent authentication in recent years and presents the state of the art of this important research field. Secondly, we investigate the feasibility of extracting long-term memory ability from users&amp;#x0027; brainwaves. Thirdly, we conduct the bio-features identified in the brainwaves of users as authentication tokens in the proposed authentication system which transparently performs continuous (or real-time) entity verification in the background without the need for direct input from the user. Experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed authentication system in achieving high verification accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Link prediction in dynamic networks aims to predict edges according to historical linkage status. It is inherently difficult because of the linear/non-linear transformation of underlying structures. The problem of efficiently performing dynamic link inference is extremely challenging due to the scale of networks and different evolving patterns. Most previous approaches for link prediction are based on members&amp;#x2019; similarity and supervised learning methods. However, research work on investigating hidden patterns of dynamic social networks are rarely conducted. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that incorporate a deep learning method, i.e., Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine, and a machine learning approach, i.e., Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. The proposed model is capable of modeling each link&amp;#x2019;s evolving patterns. We also propose a novel transformation for input matrix, which significantly reduce the computational complexity and make our algorithm scalable to large networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world dynamic networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>People use social networks to share millions of stories every day, but these stories rarely become viral. Can we estimate the probability that a story becomes a viral cascade If so, can we find a set of users that are more likely to trigger viral cascades These estimation and maximization problems are very challenging since both rare-event nature of viral cascades and efficiency requirement should be considered. Unfortunately, this problem still remains largely unexplored to date. In this paper, given temporal dynamics of a network, we first develop an efficient viral cascade probability estimation method, VICE, that leverages an special importance sampling approximation to achieve high accuracy, even in the cases of very small probability of influence. We then show that selection the most influential nodes in this model is NP-hard, and develop an efficient viral cascade probability maximization method, VICEM, that maximizes a surrogate submodular function using a greedy algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that VICE can accurately estimate viral cascade probabilities using fewer samples than naive sampling by at least two orders of magnitude, and also VICEM finds a set of users with higher viral cascade probability than alternatives. Additionally, experiments show that these algorithms are robust across different network topologies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social annotations are easy to adopt and widely used, but easiness leads to problems like ambiguity and noise. We present a probabilistic model that explains social tags by modeling the latent reason of each tag, namely the Tag Allocation Model (TAM), which disambiguates tags and identi&amp;amp;#xFB01;es the noise. We evaluate TAM &amp;amp;#x2019;s predictability on unseen data, and also test the model&amp;amp;#x2019;s performance in two real world tasks: tag recommendation and tag relation discovery. More applications of TAM could be explored.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Execution speed seriously bothers application developers and users for wearable devices such as Google Glass. Intensive applications like 3D games suffer from significant delays when CPU is busy. Energy is another concern when the devices are in low battery level but users need them for urgency use. To ease such pains, one approach is to expand the computational power by cloud offloading. This paradigm works well when the available Internet access has enough bandwidth. Another way is to leverage nearby devices for computation-offloading, which is known as device-to-device (D2D) offloading. In this paper, we present Dandelion, a unified code offloading system for wearable computing. Dandelion is a novel generic code offloading system for wearable computing with a reference implementation on Google Glass. Dandelion includes a programmer friendly framework based on Java annotation, a lightweight offloading service, and a runtime task scheduler to make offloading decisions. We design some wearable applications and several parallel execution benchmark methods for Dandelion performance evaluation. Extensive experiments on a testbed of Google Glass and Android phones demonstrate that Dandelion generally achieves over 5X execution speedup for local execution and can quickly recover from errors caused by network disruption.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Since the Analytic network process (ANP) is much more flexible than the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in handling the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems in which the criteria or sub-criteria are interdependent, it has attracted many scholars&amp;#x2019; attention and has been applied into many different areas. Given the powerfulness of intuitionistic fuzzy set in representing positive, negative and indeterminate information, this paper investigates the ANP framework for the MCDM problems in which all the pairwise comparison judgment information over the objects are represented by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. We first justify the way to decompose the MCDM problem into a holarchy and network structure, based on which, the intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) can be constructed through pairwise comparisons over the goals, criteria, clusters as well as the elements. Considering that not all the IFPRs are consistent, we then propose a new method to derive the priorities from the IFPRs no matter the IFPRs are consistent or not. After that, we address the way to construct the supermatrix for those interdependent elements. The complete algorithm of intuitionistic fuzzy ANP (IFANP) is given and illustrated by a flow chart. To show the applicability and efficiency of the IFANP, we implement the method to a case study concerning the brand management of the six golden flowers of Sichuan liquor. Some comparative analyses are given to clarify the advantages and invalidation of the IFANP.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks have not yet received considerable research attention. Specifically, security issues are a major concern because such networks, which carry vital information, are prone to various attacks. In this paper, we design and implement a novel intrusion detection and response scheme, which operates at the UAV and ground station levels, to detect malicious anomalies that threaten the network. In this scheme, a set of detection and response techniques are proposed to monitor the UAV behaviors and categorize them into the appropriate list (normal, abnormal, suspect, and malicious) according to the detected cyber-attack. We focus on the most lethal cyber-attacks that can target an UAV network, namely, false information dissemination, GPS spoofing, jamming, and black hole and gray hole attacks. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed scheme performs well in terms of attack detection even with a large number of UAVs and attackers since it exhibits a high detection rate, a low number of false positives, and prompt detection with a low communication overhead.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Our experience of the world is multimodal - we see objects, hear sounds, feel texture, smell odors, and taste flavors. Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning} aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Opportunistic computing is a paradigm for completely self-organised pervasive networks. Instead of relying only on fixed infrastructures as the cloud, users&amp;#x0027; devices act as service providers for each other. They use pairwise contacts to collect information about services provided and amount of time to provide them by the encountered nodes. At each node, upon generation of a service request, this information is used to choose the most efficient service, or composition of services, that satisfy that request, based on local knowledge. Opportunistic computing can be exploited in several scenarios, including mobile social networks, IoT and Internet 4.0. In this paper we propose an opportunistic computing algorithm based on an analytical model, which ranks the available (composition of) services, based on their expected completion time. Through the model, a service requesters picks the one that is expected to be the best. Experiments show that the algorithm is accurate in ranking services, thus providing an effective service-selection policy. Such a policy achieves significantly lower service provisioning times compared to other reference policies. Its performance is tested in a wide range of scenarios varying the nodes mobility, the size of input/output parameters, the level of resource congestion, the computational complexity of service executions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>After deploying a large number of smart meters, utilities are challenged with managing a massive set of interval energy consumption data and decoding the information into meaningful measures that can help them. These new tasks need a more detailed understanding of customers than was previously sought because customers vary widely in their usage, needs, and suitability for different programs and pricing packages. Defining and describing different customer segments will equip decision makers with information to advance not only in pricing and program marketing, but also resource allocation and program development. Therefore, among many applications, customer lifestyle segmentation can unlock potential energy-savings and can help utilities understand operating requirements and better coordinate energy resources for grid management. This paper focuses on how to segment customers&amp;#x2019; lifestyles based on their electricity consumption data and provides suggestions on which lifestyle groups can be good candidates for certain energy programs based on the segmentation result.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the help of various assistive devices, people with visual impairments are able to live their lives with greater independence both online and offline. But significant work remains to understand and address their safety, security, and privacy concerns, especially in the physical, offline world. For example, people with visual impairments are particularly vulnerable to physical assault and theft, shoulder-surfing attacks, and being overheard during private conversations. We conducted two sets of interviews, one in a small-town setting and the other in a larger metropolitan area, with 33 participants with visual impairments to identify their physical safety, security and privacy concerns, how they manage these concerns, and how assistive technologies could help alleviate them. Our research proposes design considerations for camera-based devices that would help people with visual impairments monitor for potential threats around them.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the rapid development of Web, large numbers of documents assigned by readers&amp;#x2019; emotions have been generated through new portals. Comparing to the previous studies which focused on author&amp;#x2019;s perspective, our research focuses on readers&amp;#x2019; emotions invoked by news articles. Our research provides meaningful assistance in social media application such as sentiment retrieval, opinion summarization and election prediction. In this paper, we predict the readers&amp;#x2019; emotion of news based on the social opinion network. More specifically, we construct the opinion network based on the semantic distance. The communities in the news network indicate specific events which are related to the emotions. Therefore, the opinion network serves as the lexicon between events and corresponding emotions. We leverage neighbor relationship in network to predict readers&amp;#x2019; emotions. As a result, our methods obtain better result than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we developed a growing strategy to prune the network for practical application. The experiment verifies the rationality of the reduction for application.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Personal health records (PHRs), centralized places for consumers to electronically store, manage, and share their personal health information, offer new opportunities to help consumers manage their own health and health care. However, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of health information contained within PHRs is challenging. This paper analyzes the major properties of existing PHR systems and identifies specific privacy and security issues with each type of PHR. It proposes a consumer-controlled privacy protection approach that includes high-minded privacy principles such as independent consent management, independent privacy and security audits, and regulatory compliance requirements. It further presents a consumer-controlled system architecture that embodies these principles in the web-based PHR system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A human being&amp;#x2019;s cognitive system can be simulated by artificial intelligent systems. Machines and robots equipped with cognitive capability can automatically recognize a humans mental state through their gestures and facial expressions. In this paper, an artificial intelligent system is proposed to monitor depression. It can predict the scales of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) from vocal and visual expressions. Firstly, different visual features are extracted from facial expression images. Deep Learning method is utilized to extract key visual features from the facial expression frames. Secondly, Spectral Low-level Descriptors (LLDs) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) features are extracted from short audio segments to capture the vocal expressions. Thirdly, Feature Dynamic History Histogram (FDHH) is proposed to capture the temporal movement on the feature space. Finally these FDHH and Audio features are fused using regression techniques for the prediction of the BDI-II scales. The proposed method has been tested on the public AVEC2014 dataset as it is tuned to be more focused on the study of depression. The results outperform all the other existing methods on the same dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Network defense and attack problems can be modeled as network interdictions. In this paper, we consider a new version of the network interdiction problem that optimizes the interdictor&amp;#x2019;s resource consumption while limiting network capacities (e.g., the shortest path) to a specified threshold. Interdictors would balance the interdiction performance and resource consumption when maximizing the performance costs too much. The most frequently-used technique is to relax the maximization restraint to certain specified threshold; however, the known algorithms provide little help in calculating the threshold restraint. We present a novel model named Minimizing the Interdiction Resource with Goal Threshold (MIRGT) based on the shortest path interdiction problem and propose two basic algorithms to solve it based on Benders decomposition and Lagrange duality, respectively. To consider the situation of complete interdiction and that of a large threshold, a corresponding set-covering algorithm and a Lagrange approximate algorithm are presented. Computational experiments show that decomposition-based algorithms generally perform better on small-world networks while duality based algorithms perform better on regular grid networks. Analyses on network property sensitivity show that the decomposition-based algorithms are sensitive to the threshold value while the duality based algorithms become weaker as the interdiction increment grows. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of these two basic algorithms on a real-world Chicago transportation network. The result illustrates a significant advance; both algorithms can compute an optimal strategy for problems that scale up to real-world sizes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Redundant and non-operational buildings at nuclear sites are decommissioned over a period of time. The process involves demolition of physical infrastructure resulting in large quantities of residual waste material. The resulting waste materials are packed into import containers to be delivered for post-processing, containing either sealed canisters or assortments of miscellaneous objects. At present post-processing does not happen within the United Kingdom. Sellafield Ltd. and National Nuclear Laboratory are developing a process for future operation so that upon an initial inspection, imported waste materials undergo two stages of post-processing before being packed into export containers, namely sort and segregate or sort and disrupt. The post-processing facility will remotely treat and export a wide range of wastes before downstream encapsulation. Certain wastes require additional treatment, such as disruption, before export to ensure suitability for long-term disposal. This article focuses on the design, development, and demonstration of a reconfigurable rational agent-based robotic system that aims to highly automate these processes removing the need for close human supervision. The proposed system is being demonstrated through a downsized, lab-based setup incorporating a small-scale robotic arm, a time-of-flight camera, and high-level rational agent-based decision making and control framework.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Real-time crowdsourced maps, such as Waze provide timely updates on traffic, congestion, accidents, and points of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate how lack of strong location authentication allows creation of software-based Sybil devices that expose crowdsourced map systems to a variety of security and privacy attacks. Our experiments show that a single Sybil device with limited resources can cause havoc on Waze, reporting false congestion and accidents and automatically rerouting user traffic. More importantly, we describe techniques to generate Sybil devices at scale, creating armies of virtual vehicles capable of remotely tracking precise movements for large user populations while avoiding detection. To defend against Sybil devices, we propose a new approach based on co-location edges, authenticated records that attest to the one-time physical co-location of a pair of devices. Over time, co-location edges combine to form large proximity graphs that attest to physical interactions between devices, allowing scalable detection of virtual vehicles. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using large-scale simulations, and how they can be used to dramatically reduce the impact of the attacks. We have informed Waze/Google team of our research findings. Currently, we are in active collaboration with Waze team to improve the security and privacy of their system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Electric vehicles (EVs) are recognized as one of the most promising technologies worldwide to address the fossil fuel energy resource crisis and environmental pollution. As the initial work of EV charging station (EVCS) construction, site selection plays a vital role in its whole life cycle, which, however, is a complicated multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem involving many conflicting criteria. Therefore, this work aims to propose a novel integrated MCDM approach by a grey decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and uncertain linguistic multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus full multiplicative form (UL-MULTIMOORA) for determining the most suitable EVCS site in terms of multiple interrelated criteria. Specifically, the grey DEMATEL method is used to determine criteria weights and the UL-MULTIMOORA model is employed to evaluate and select the optimal site. Finally, an empirical example in Shanghai, China, is presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is a useful, practical, and effective way to find the optimal location of EVCSs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes a new method called Multimodal RNNs for RGB-D scene semantic segmentation. It is optimized to classify image pixels given two input sources: RGB color channels and Depth maps. It simultaneously performs training of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are crossly connected through information transfer layers, which are learnt to adaptively extract relevant cross modality features. Each RNN model learns its representations from its own previous hidden states and transferred patterns from the other RNNs previous hidden states, thus, both model-specific and crossmodality features are retained. We exploit the structure of quad-directional 2D-RNNs to model the short and long range contextual information in the 2D input image. We carefully designed various baselines to efficiently examine our proposed model structure. We test our Multimodal RNNs method on popular RGB-D benchmarks and show how it outperforms previous methods significantly and achieves competitive results with other state-of-the-art works.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Textual emotion detection has a high impact on business, society, politics or education with applications such as, detecting depression or personality traits, suicide prevention or identifying cases of cyber-bulling. Given this context, the objective of our research is to contribute to the improvement of emotion recognition task through an automatic technique focused on reducing both the time and cost needed to develop emotion corpora. Our proposal is to exploit a bootstrapping approach based on intensional learning for automatic annotations with two main steps: 1) an initial similarity-based categorization where a set of seed sentences is created and extended by distributional semantic similarity (word vectors or word embeddings); 2) train a supervised classifier on the initially categorized set. The technique proposed allows us an efficient annotation of a large amount of emotion data with standards of reliability according to the evaluation results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting the popularity of Point of Interest (POI) has become increasingly crucial for location-based services, such as POI recommendation. Most of the existing methods can seldom achieve satisfactory performance due to the scarcity of POI&amp;#x0027;s information, which tendentiously confines the recommendation to popular scene spots, and ignores the unpopular attractions with potentially precious values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed Hierarchical Multi-Clue Fusion (HMCF), for predicting the popularity of POIs. Specifically, in order to cope with the problem of data sparsity, we propose to comprehensively describe POI using various types of UGC content (e.g., text and image) from multiple sources. Then, we devise an effective POI modelling method in a hierarchical manner, which simultaneously injects semantic knowledge as well as multi-clue representative power into POIs. For evaluation, we construct a multi-source POI dataset by collecting all the textual and visual content of several specific provinces in China from four main-stream tourism platforms during 2006 to 2017. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of predicting the attractions&amp;#x0027; popularity as compared to several baseline methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The advent and proliferation of social media have led to the development of mathematical models describing the evolution of beliefs/opinions in an ecosystem composed of socially interacting users. The goal is to gain insights into collective dominant social beliefs and into the impact of different components of the system, such as users&amp;#x0027; interactions, while being able to predict users&amp;#x0027; opinions. Following this thread, in this paper we consider a fairly general dynamical model of social interactions, which captures all the main features exhibited by a social system. For such model, by embracing a mean-field approach, we derive a diffusion differential equation that represents asymptotic belief dynamics, as the number of users grows large. We then analyze the steady-state behavior as well as the time dependent (transient) behavior of the system. In particular, for the steady-state distribution, we obtain simple closed-form expressions for a relevant class of systems, while we propose efficient semi-analytical techniques in the most general cases. At last, we develop an efficient semi-analytical method to analyze the dynamics of the users&amp;#x0027; belief over time, which can be applied to a remarkably large class of systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Deep learning has achieved great successes in conventional computer vision tasks. In this paper, we exploit deep learning techniques to address the hyperspectral image classification problem. In contrast to conventional computer vision tasks that only examine the spatial context, our proposed method can exploit both spatial context and spectral correlation to enhance hyperspectral image classification. In particular, we advocate four new deep learning models, namely, 2-D convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN), 3-D-CNN, recurrent 2-D CNN (R-2-D-CNN), and recurrent 3-D-CNN (R-3-D-CNN) for hyperspectral image classification. We conducted rigorous experiments based on six publicly available data sets. Through a comparative evaluation with other state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed deep learning models, especially the R-3-D-CNN and the R-2-D-CNN deep learning models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Educational computer-based competition environments need to be designed with a set of features that enhance the learning process. Although recently some frameworks for the design of educational computer-based systems (e.g., educational games) have been proposed, they do not focus on the details of the competition. Therefore, the design of educational computer-based competition environments is still an open issue. We propose the 4NESS framework for the design of such competition environments. This framework classifies the competition features into four dimensions: easiness, fairness, awareness, and adaptiveness. We designed the ISCARE educational computer-based competition environment implementing these four dimensions to evaluate and validate some included features for competition, and conducted experiments during three consecutive years. Students considered the computer-based competition environment with the proposed features, including a modification of the Swiss system, to be very easy to use, fair for pairing students, moderately fair for calculating scores, with good awareness of their state during the competition and that of their peers, and with contents of appropriate level, especially for the group working with adaptive contents. Adaptation of contents made students increase their learning gains in 0.5 sigmas during the competition. Pairings were seen as with students of similar levels. And final scores were moderately fair: while the order tends to be similar as compared to the results in the post-test, students&amp;#x0027; grades with high performance tend to be lower in the competition environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Energy Management Systems (EMS) are mainly price driven with minimal consumer interaction. To improve the effectiveness of EMS in the context of demand response, an alternative EMS control framework driven by resident behavior patterns is developed. Using hidden Markov modeling techniques, the EMS detects consumer behavior from real-time aggregate consumption and a pre-built dictionary of reference models. These models capture variations in consumer habits as a function of daily living activity sequence. Following a training period, the system identifies the best fit model which is used to estimate the current state of the resident. When a request to activate a time-shiftable appliance is made, the control agent compares grid signals, user convenience constraints, and the current consumer state estimate to predict the likelihood that the future aggregate load exceeds a consumption threshold during the operating cycle of the requested device. Based on the outcome, the control agent initiates or defers the activation request. Using three consumer reference models, a case study assessing EMS performance with respect to model detection, state estimation, and control as a function of consumer comfort and grid-informed consumption constraints is presented. A tradeoff analysis between comfort, consumption threshold, and appliance activation delay is demonstrated.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be seriously impacted by several changes in behavior. As a measure of optimality, a network should react in real-time. However, even if some reactions can make the system flexible, they can cause significant damages when they are not well-structured. Moreover, the scenarios of reconfigurations can affect several parameters within a wireless sensor network. Among these parameters it is possible to name the energy efficiency, the memory limitation within a node, the real-time constraints at the level of the nodes and the network in general. Either through the application or the transmission of the reconfiguration scenarios, some parameters are severely altered. A metamorphosis of the internal architecture of the nodes is proposed in this research work as well as a policy of communication between several nodes aiming to adapt the network to any change. The resulting proposition offers general efficiency in energy and real-time constraints. The efficiency is realized by the application of a pipelined approach, dealing with the incoming reconfiguration scenarios, and a communication protocol, based on a priority energy and deadline aware scheduling algorithm (a multicriteria scheduling algorithm). This protocol is capable of optimizing the transmission of both reconfiguration scenarios and sensed data simultaneously. The solution is tested on a network connecting several cars during an automobile journey and the results validate the efficiency of this proposition.</dcterms:abstract>

(Corresponding author: Linbo Qing) Aiming at low-complexity encoding, distributed video coding (DVC) based on the Wyner-Ziv theorem has attracted significant attention. However, there is still a compression performance gap between the state-of-the-art DVC and the conventional video coding. One of the most important factors is the efficient estimation of the source correlation statistics. The first-order Laplacian distribution has been widely used for source correlation modeling, but not effective enough; high-order statistical modeling is necessary, but needs more context features for the estimation of a source symbol&amp;#x2019;s conditional probability. How to analyze the strength of the correlation between the source symbol and the context features in order to utilize the features effectively is crucial for such modeling. In this paper, the estimation of the source statistical distribution is first treated as a classification problem. The symbols of the source can be classified into different classes when the relevant context features are given. Then decision tree learning is introduced to analyze the strength of the correlation between the source symbol and the context features. Specifically, by constructing the decision trees composed of the selected context features, the selected context features can be organized effectively to derive the rules to estimate the current symbol&amp;#x2019;s conditional probability, upon which the high-order statistical modeling is designed. Experimental results show the prop- sed model can achieve significant coding gain over existing DVC systems, especially for natural videos with high motion intensity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Graphic design tools provide powerful controls for expert-level design creation, but the options can often be overwhelming for novices. This paper proposes Context-Aware Asset Search tools that take the current state of the user&amp;#x0027;s design into account, thereby providing search and selections that are compatible with the current design and better fit the user&amp;#x0027;s needs. In particular, we focus on image search and color selection, two tasks that are central to design. We learn a model for compatibility of images and colors within a design, using crowdsourced data. We then use the learned model to rank image search results or color suggestions during design. We found counterintuitive behavior using conventional training with pairwise comparisons for image search, where models with and without compatibility performed similarly. We describe a data collection procedure that alleviates this problem. We show that our method outperforms baseline approaches in quantitative evaluation, and we also evaluate a prototype interactive design tool.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We present a bibliographic and coauthorship-based collaboration analysis of papers published in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS) between 2014 and 2016 from the aspects of productivity, topics, citations, usage, and coauthorship networks. The most productive authors, institutions, countries/regions, and the most cited papers, most popular papers, as well as the most frequent topics and their trends are identified and analyzed. Social network methods are employed for revealing collaboration patterns among contributors through author- and institution-level coauthorship. The results show that China is playing a critical role in ITS research during this period but the interinstitution collaborations are less prevalent than it used to be. Overall data have indicated that IEEE T-ITS has made tremendous progress and contributed significantly to the accelerated growth of ITS fields over the last three years.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The percentage of processed large-scale heterogeneous data is exploding and technology is the most obvious reason for the big data issue. Nowadays, the results of data expansion are showing up in different fields. The users' contextual data are valuable in engineering and business domains, e.g., transportation, location-based services, and advertisement industry. Take mobile phones as an example. There are billions of subscriptions worldwide and sensor devices are digitizing people interactions. The data volume generated by mobile phones and the need to make better, fact-based, and real-time decisions, are the challenges facing researchers. Recently, new technologies based on cloud computing have emerged to process and analyze a large volume of data. We have utilized such technologies for the analysis of call detail records with the collaboration with a telecommunications company. We present an exploratory spatial data analysis algorithm and its analysis results. To prioritize different areas, detecting hotspots in a fast and accurate way is our objective. The findings of this research work can be helpful for urban planning and development as well as telecommunication infrastructure upgrading.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>As a scene-independent descriptor of crowd motions, crowd collectiveness quantifies the degree of constituent individuals moving as a union in a crowd scene. An effective measurement on crowd collectiveness is of great importance for applications in surveillance of public safety, human dynamics, and other areas. To this end, we propose a novel framework to measure crowd collectiveness by combining macroscopic and microscopic motion consistency and define quantitatively the global and local consistency of crowd motions. The defined global consistency represents the likelihood of pairwise individuals belonging to the same collective group, while the local consistency reflects the degree of conformity in a local region. Based on the proposed collectiveness measure, a new algorithm, named Group Mining, is proposed to detect collective groups from a crowd. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic particle systems and a real world crowd database with human-labeled collectiveness. Experimental results show that, comparing with the previous approaches, our collectiveness measure is more consistent with human perception, and the collective groups detected by our Group Mining algorithm are more accurate and robust.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Human behaviors are known to spread through social contact. The diffusion process on social networks has also been leveraged to understand the spread of undesirable contagion. The contagion of malicious or even criminal behaviors in online social networks is just beginning to attract attention. Here we study the social contagion problem of cheating behavior found in the MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that provides a lifelike environment with rich and realistic user interactions. Because cheating users boast an abnormal thus conspicuous degree of success, it has a strong chance of being noticed by their friends and leading them to cheat themselves. To detect and prevent cheating, it is beneficial to understand this dynamic as a contagion problem. In this study, we show the existence of the contagion of cheating. We then explore various possible social reinforcement mechanisms after introducing several factors to quantify the effect of social reinforcement on the contagion, and analyze the dynamics of bot diffusion in an extensive user interaction log from a major MMORPG.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recently, a prevailing trend of user generated content (UGC) on social media sites is the emerging micro-videos. Micro-videos afford many potential opportunities ranging from network content caching to online advertising, yet there are still little efforts dedicated to research on micro-video understanding. In this paper, we focus on popularity prediction of micro-videos by presenting a novel low-rank multi-view embedding learning framework. We name it as transductive low-rank multi-view regression (TLRMVR), and it is capable of boosting the performance of micro-video popularity prediction by jointly considering the intrinsic representations of the source and target samples. In particular, TLRMVR integrates low-rank multi-view embedding and regression analysis into a unified framework such that the lowest-rank representation shared by all views not only captures the global structure of all views, but also indicates the regression requirements. The framework is formulated as a regression model and it seeks a set of view-specific projection matrices with low-rank constraints to map multi-view features into a common subspace. In addition, a graph regularization term is constructed to improve the generalisation capability and further prevents the overfitting problem. Extensive experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieve promising results as compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we propose a novel General-NMF (General Non-negative Matrix Factorization) based digital watermarking scheme for copyright protection and integrity authentication of digital media content. Specifically, the proposed General-NMF algorithm is able to factorize a matrix C &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${in}R{^{s times t}_{+}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; decomposed into a basis matrix A &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${in}R{^{m times n}_{+}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; and a coefficient matrix B &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${in}R{^{p times q}_{+}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; by removing the dimension matching constraints required by the traditional NMF, where &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$s=m, n=p$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; and &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$t=q$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;. In particular, &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$s=m cdot l/n, t=l/p cdot q$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;, and the variable l is the least common multiple of n and p. Furthermore, the generator factor of the random matrix and n are used as the keys of the proposed digital watermarking scheme. Experiment results show that the proposed digital watermarking scheme can effectively resist various attacks and tampering.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Spatial data have wide applications, e.g., location-based services, and geometric range queries (i.e., finding points inside geometric areas, e.g., circles or polygons) are one of the fundamental search functions over spatial data. The rising demand of outsourcing data is moving large-scale datasets, including large-scale spatial datasets, to public clouds. Meanwhile, due to the concern of insider attackers and hackers on public clouds, the privacy of spatial datasets should be cautiously preserved while querying them at the server side, especially for location-based and medical usage. In this paper, we formalize the concept of Geometrically Searchable Encryption, and propose an efficient scheme, named FastGeo, to protect the privacy of clients&amp;#x2019; spatial datasets stored and queried at a public server. With FastGeo, which is a novel two-level search for encrypted spatial data, an honest-but-curious server can efficiently perform geometric range queries, and correctly return data points that are inside a geometric range to a client without learning sensitive data points or this private query. FastGeo supports arbitrary geometric areas, achieves sublinear search time, and enables dynamic updates over encrypted spatial datasets. Our scheme is provably secure, and our experimental results on real-world spatial datasets in cloud platform demonstrate that FastGeo can boost search time over 100 times.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Graph is an important data representation which appears in a wide diversity of real-world scenarios. Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work address these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques and application scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm links physical objects in the real world to cyber world and enables the creation of smart environments and applications. A Physical object is the fundamental building block of the IoT, known as a Smart Device, that can monitor the environment. These devices can communicate with each other and have data processing abilities. When deployed, smart devices collect real-time data and publish the gathered data on the web. The functionality of smart devices can be abstracted as a service and an IoT application can be built by combining the smart devices with these services that help to address challenges of day-to-day activities. The IoT comprises billions of these intelligent communicating devices that generate enormous amount of data, and hence performing analysis on this data is a significant task. Using search techniques, the size and extent of data can be reduced and limited, so that an application can choose just the most important and valuable data items as per its necessities. It is, however, a tedious task to effectively seek and select a proper device and/or its data among a large number of available devices for a specific application. Search techniques is fundamental to IoT and poses various challenges like a large number of devices, dynamic availability, restrictions on resource utilization, real time data in various types and formats, past and historical monitoring. In the recent past, various methods and techniques have been developed by the research community to address these issues. In this paper, we present a review of the state-of-the-art search methods for the IoT, classifying them according to their design principle and search approaches as: IoT Data and IoT Object-based techniques. Under each classification, we describe the method adopted, their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we identify and discuss key challenges and future research directions that will allow the next generation search techniques to recognize- and respond to user queries and satisfy the information needs of users.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In multiple analysis tasks and personalized services, tremendous challenges in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) are clustering large-scale multi-source data and generating multiple distinct clusterings dependent on different applications. To address these challenges, this paper first presents two simple multiple clustering methods which can produce different clustering results according to arbitrarily selected combinations of features, one is similarity matrices-based multiple clusterings which computes the weighted average of similarity matrices for selected feature spaces, another is Euclidean distance-based multiple clusterings which fuses different feature spaces using selective weighted Euclidean distance. Furthermore, a tensor decomposition-based multiple clusterings is presented for efficiently clustering high-dimensional data, and a multi-relational attribute ranking method is further proposed to improve the clustering performance. This paper illustrates and evaluates the proposed methods on a design example and a real world data set. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively cluster big data to provide enhanced knowledge extractions and services in CPSS.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the traditional reliable multicast schemes of wire-less cellular network, base station (BS) repeatedly transmits the same packet until it is received by all receivers. The use of device-to-device (D2D) communication can greatly offload the traffic of BS. This paper considers D2D communication based multicast from BS to a cluster of devices which are close to one another (e.g., in the same building). So far, the efficient D2D retransmis-sion scheme available is to associate each NACK-device (which did not correctly receive the data from BS) to some near ACK-device (which correctly received the data) for forming subclusters, and let ACK-devices retransmit the data to their respective associated NACK-devices in the FDMA mode by using multiple channels, aiming to minimize the time-frequency resource cost. Noticing that the total available channels are very limited and the devices&amp;#x2019; energy is a very precious resource, in this work, we first present the subcluster based single-channel D2D retransmission way where the ACK-devices use the same channel in the TDMA mode. Then, aiming to minimize the total energy consumption of retransmitters, we formulate the joint optimization of NACK-devices&amp;#x2019; association and retransmitters&amp;#x2019; transmission powers to be a mixed integer programming problem. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm for this problem to find a good association pattern and transmission powers. Simulation results show that, using D2D communication greatly reduces multicast traffic load of BS. Moreover, compared to its counterparts with a fixed number of retransmitters, our retransmission scheme greatly reduces the total energy consumption of retransmitters.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Several methods have recently been proposed to analyze speech and automatically infer the personality of the speaker. These methods often rely on prosodic and other hand crafted speech processing features extracted with off-the-shelf toolboxes. To achieve high accuracy, numerous features are typically extracted using complex and highly parameterized algorithms. In this paper, a new method based on feature learning and spectrogram analysis is proposed to simplify the feature extraction process while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The proposed method learns a dictionary of discriminant features from patches extracted in the spectrogram representations of training speech segments. Each speech segment is then encoded using the dictionary, and the resulting feature set is used to perform classification of personality traits. Experiments indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with an important reduction in complexity when compared to the most recent reference methods. The number of features, and difficulties linked to the feature extraction process are greatly reduced as only one type of descriptors is used, for which the 7 parameters can be tuned automatically. In contrast, the simplest reference method uses 4 types of descriptors to which 6 functionals are applied, resulting in over 20 parameters to be tuned.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) query has been gaining more importance in extensive applications involving information retrieval, data mining and databases. Specifically, in order to trade off accuracy for efficiency, approximate solutions for the k-NN query are extensively explored. However, the precision is usually order-insensitive, which is defined on the result set instead of the result sequence. In many situations, it cannot reasonably reflect the query result quality. In this paper, we focus on the approximate k-NN query problem with the order-sensitive precision requirement and propose a novel scheme based on the projection-filter-refinement framework. Basically, we adopt PCA to project the high-dimensional data objects into the low-dimensional space. Then, a filter condition is inferred to execute efficient pruning over the projected data. In addition, an index strategy named OR-tree is proposed to reduce the I/O cost. The extensive experiments based on several real-world data sets and a synthetic data set are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method can support order-sensitive k-NN queries with higher result precision while retaining satisfactory CPU and I/O efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the explosion growth of mobile data demands for proximal services, device-to-device (D2D) communication is proposed as a vital technology for the next generation cellular network. With the extensive increase in personal mobile devices, content transmission of proximal devices underlaying cellular networks is gaining considerable attention. However, due to the mobility constraint of mobile devices, content transmission under- laying cellular networks greatly affects the overall transmission capacity of these proximal devices. In this paper, we investi- gate the problem of mobility assisted content transmission and resource allocation by exploiting the contact patterns regulated by these proximal devices' mobility. We formulate the content transmission and resource allocation with the help of the statistic property of contact rates, and then utilize convex optimization to determine the successful content transmission and resource allocation scheme. We present the optimal resource allocated content transmission (RACT) algorithm based on the pseudo- polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem. Real data traces are utilized in our proposed algorithm to find out the natural strategies of mobile homophily. Extensive simulations under the realistic human mobility factors are evaluated to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed scheme.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The increasing algorithmic complexity and dataset sizes necessitate the use of networked machines for many graph-parallel algorithms, which also makes fault tolerance a must due to the increasing scale of machines. Unfortunately, existing large-scale graph-parallel systems usually adopt a distributed checkpoint mechanism for fault tolerance, which incurs not only notable performance overhead but also lengthy recovery time. This paper observes that the vertex replicas created for distributed graph computation can be naturally extended for fast in-memory recovery of graph states. This paper describes Imitator, a new fault tolerance mechanism, which supports cheap maintenance of vertex states by replicating them to their replicas during normal message exchanges, and provides fast in-memory reconstruction of failed vertices from replicas in other machines. Imitator has been implemented on Cyclops with edge-cut and PowerLyra with vertex-cut. Evaluation on a 50-node EC-2 like cluster shows that Imitator incurs an average of 1.37% and 2.32% performance overhead (ranging from -0.6% to 3.7%) for Cyclops and PowerLyra respectively, and can recover from failures of more than one million of vertices with less than 3.4 seconds.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Global corporations are characterised by a large number of employees and geographically dispersed offices. Moreover, the competitiveness in the global market requires them to invest in their human resources to be able to remain a step ahead of competition. Implementing large scale classical education in such environments is challenging and costly. Mobile e-learning (m-learning) allows users to tailor their professional training and education to their needs and time constraints. However, in self-paced education it is very hard to keep user retention and engagement. To achieve the latter we have designed and developed an m-learning platform for corporate environments based on the triggering persuasive technology principle that try to incite users in regularly using the platform. We have evaluated the application in-the-wild in corporate environments of differently sized companies with 300 users. Users were subjected to three different conditions: no triggering, simple regular triggering and adaptive triggering. The results show that the use of adaptive triggering in m-learning increases user engagement as well as course completion rates more than simple regular triggering and no triggering.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Abstract|In communicating resource systems (CRS), a set of independent, hierarchically composed resources communicate to realize a business process. Examples of CRSs include RESTful Web services, cloud computing platforms and hierarchical distributed systems. Unfortunately, their complexity, distributed nature, and usually long lifespan can lead to problems like livelocks, deadlock occurrences and invocation loops. This makes CRSs hard to maintain and manage; it also leads to a loss of QoS or system failures. Moreover, it is important to take into account, in system management, the exact way how the system gets to some desired or undesired state. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze processes, executed in a system to nd and x the above problems. Unfortunately, CRS process models are hardly ever available. Therefore, we present a new distributed algorithm, dRMA, discovering process models from CRS event logs. In order to reduce the representational bias between the discovered process model and the real process, we have dened a Communication Net, which can express features of CRSs: directed communication channels, hierarchy, and a resource perspective. Finally, we have evaluated dRMA on a cluster, and have showed that distributing jobs can signicantly reduce the time of process model discovery.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Most previous works on first-person video recognition focus on measuring the similarity of different actions by using low-level features of objects interacting with humans. However, due to noisy camera motion and frequent changes in viewpoint and scale, they fail to capture and model highly discriminative object features. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline for first-person daily activity recognition. Our object feature extraction pipeline is inspired by the recent success of object hypotheses and deep convolutional neural network based detection frameworks. Our key contribution is a simple yet effective manipulated object proposal generation scheme. This scheme leverages motion cues such as motion boundary and motion magnitude (in contrast, camera motion is usually considered as &amp;#x201C;noise&amp;#x201D; for most previous methods) to generate a more compact and discriminative set of object proposals, which are more closely related to the objects which are being manipulated. Then, we learn more discriminative object detectors from these manipulated object proposals based on region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN). Meanwhile, we develop a non-linear feature fusion scheme which better combines object and motion features. We show in experiments that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recognition performance on a challenging first-person daily activity benchmark.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In human-centered smart systems, traditional cloud computing has been well adopted for several years for supporting IoT applications of smart systems, however, the requirements of the IoT applications vary due to different tasks in the smart systems. In order to offer location-aware, latencysensitive monitoring and intelligent control for IoT applications in the smart systems like smart home or smart grid, we introduce fog computing and discuss the combination of fog computing and data center hoping to improve the quality of experience of users in human-centered smart systems. In this paper, we propose a three-layer architecture of the data center by introducing the fog computing layer between the traditional centralized data center and terminal nodes. Performance related service latency of different cloud services is modeled and evaluated based on it. It is verified that the new architecture has a great improvement in terms of service latency and network load by simulation experiments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recent initiatives in software development process have stressed the importance of better integration of different aspects of the overall process. Agile methods have linked business analysis and development, and DevOps better connects development with operational deployment. In our recent studies, however, we found little integration with another aspect of operations: incident response. Our studies show that, above the help desk level, incident response teams often gain deep knowledge about the experience of using products and services. If the overall process were to support a connection back to design, this knowledge represents significant opportunities for innovation. Incidents can be more than simply resolved: they can lead to valuable insight.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the residential sector, new precincts are likely to include a higher uptake of solar and battery systems. One fundamental tool required to assess the impact and cost of solar and battery systems in residential precincts is a reliable model that can simulate electricity demand for individual homes. That model should capture the time-series complexity and the unique demographic composition of a precinct. In response, this research contributes to state-of-the-art demand forecasting by presenting a time-series, survey-less, demographically focused model formulation. The model achieves the survey-less feature by substituting household survey's for geodemographic profiling data, avoiding comprehensive surveying used in other research. This increases the usability for developers and network operators. The research applies the Adaptive Boost Regression Tree algorithm as an alternative to traditional methods, such as feed forward neural network (FFANN). The results investigate three case study precincts and show that this algorithm improves over an FFANN in aspects such as peak event estimation and daily variability, achieving an R2 value of 0.86. Finally, the research implements an MILP battery model and demonstrates the Demand Model is robust to provide real value battery system design, cost and impact estimations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Information source detection is to identify nodes initiating the diffusion process in a network, which has a wide range of applications including epidemic outbreak prevention, Internet virus source identification, and rumor source tracing in social networks. Although it has attracted ever-increasing attention from research community in recent years, existing solutions still suffer from high time complexity and inadequate effectiveness, due to high dynamics of information diffusion and observing just a snapshot of the whole process. To this end, we present a comprehensive study for single information source detection in weighted graphs. Specifically, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to detect the information source with other methods as the prior, which ensures our method can be integrated with others naturally. Different from many related works, we exploit both infected nodes and their uninfected neighbors to calculate the effective propagation probability, and then derive the exact formation of likelihood for general weighted graphs. To further improve the efficiency, we design two approximate MAP estimators, namely brute force search approximation (BFSA) and greedy search bound approximation (GSBA), from the perspective of likelihood approximation. BFSA tries to traverse the permitted permutations to directly compute the likelihood, but GSBA exploits a strategy of greedy search to find a surrogate upper bound of the likelihood, and thus avoids the enumeration of permitted permutations. Therefore, detecting with partial nodes and likelihood approximation reduces the computational complexity drastically for large graphs. Extensive experiments on several data sets also clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on detecting the single information source with different settings in weighted graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social network data is widely shared, transferred and published for research purposes and business interests, but it has raised much concern on users&amp;#x2019; privacy. Even though users&amp;#x2019; identity information is always removed, attackers can still de-anonymize users with the help of auxiliary information. To protect against de-anonymization attack, various privacy protection techniques for social networks have been proposed. However, most existing approaches assume specific and restrict network structure as background knowledge and ignore semantic level prior belief of attackers, which are not always realistic in practice and do not apply to arbitrary privacy scenarios. Moreover, the privacy inference attack in the presence of semantic background knowledge is barely investigated. To address these shortcomings, in this work, we introduce knowledge graphs to explicitly express arbitrary prior belief of the attacker for any individual user. The processes of de-anonymization and privacy inference are accordingly formulated based on knowledge graphs. Our experiment on data of real social networks shows that knowledge graphs can power de-anonymization and inference attacks, and thus increase the risk of privacy disclosure. This suggests the validity of knowledge graphs as a general effective model of attackers&amp;#x2019; background knowledge for social network attack and privacy preservation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Graph-based subspace segmentation technique has garnered lots of attention in visual data representation problem. Generally, data (e.g. tracks of moving objects) are drawn from multiple linear subspaces. Thus how to build a block-diagonal affinity matrix is the critical problem. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method, Ensemble Subspace Segmentation under Block-wise constraints (ESSB), which unifies least squares regression and locality preserving graph regularizer into an ensemble learning framework. Specifically, compact encoding using least squares regression coefficients helps achieve a blockdiagonal representation matrix among all samples. Meanwhile, locality preserving regularizer tends to capture the intrinsic local structure which further enhances the block-diagonal property. Both block-wise efforts, i.e., least squares regression and sparse regularizer, work jointly and are formulated in the ensemble learning framework, making ESSB more robust and efficient, especially when handling high-dimensional data. Finally, an efficient optimization solution based on inexact Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) is derived with theoretical time complexity analysis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider three different applications: face clustering, object clustering and motion segmentation. Extensive results of both accuracy and normalized mutual information on four benchmarks, i.e., YaleB, ORL, COIL and Hopkins155, are reported. Also, the evaluations of computational cost are provided, based on which, the superiority of our proposed method in both accuracy and efficiency is demonstrated compared with twelve baseline algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>As the rise of the portable devices, people usually access the social media such as Twitter and Facebook through wireless networks. Therefore, data transmission rates significant important to the end users. In this work, we discuss the problem of context-aware data caching in the heterogeneous small cell networks to reduce the service delay and how the device-to-device (D2D) and device-to-infrastructure (D2I) improve the system social welfare. In the data-caching model, we explore three types of cache entities, macro cell base stations, small cell base stations, and end user devices. We propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model to perform data analysis and extract information content from the data. By knowing the interest of the data to the cache entities, we can cache the data that will most likely to be requested by the end users to reduce service latency. In simulation, we show our proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce the service latency during 2016 U.S. presidential election where mobile user were urgent to request the election information through wireless networks. Comparing with other mechanisms such as using one-to-many matching algorithm or without D2D communication technology, our proposed algorithm improves significantly on the devices performance and system social welfare.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Teachers&amp;#x2019; online discussion text data shed light on their reflective thinking. With the growing scale of text data, the traditional way of manual coding, however, has been challenged. In order to process the large-scale unstructured text data, it is necessary to integrate the inductive content analysis method and educational data mining techniques. An inductive content analysis on samples taken from 17624 posts was implemented and the categories of teachers&amp;#x2019; reflective thinking were obtained. Based on the results of inductive content analysis, we implemented a single-label text classification algorithm to classify the sample data. Then we applied the trained classification model on a large-scale and unexplored online discussion text data set and two types of visualizations of the results were provided. By using the categories gained from inductive content analysis to create a radar map, teachers&amp;#x2019; reflection level was represented. In addition, a cumulative adjacency matrix was created to characterize the evolution of teachers&amp;#x2019; reflective thinking. This study could partly explain how teachers reflected in online professional learning environments and brought awareness to educational policy makers, teacher training managers, and education researchers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Personal videos often contain visual distractors, i.e. objects that are accidentally captured that can distract viewers from focusing on the main subjects. We propose a method to automatically detect and localize these distractors, by learning from a manually-labeled dataset. To achieve spatially- and temporally-coherent detection, we propose to extract features at the Temporal-Superpixel (TSP) level in a traditional SVM-based learning framework. We have also experimented with end-to-end learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which achieve slightly higher performance. The classification result is further refined in a post-processing step based on graph-cut optimization. Experimental results show that our method achieves an accuracy of 81% and a recall of 86%. We demonstrate several ways to remove the detected distractors to improve the video quality, including video hole filling; video frame replacement; and camera path re-planning.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the irruption of inexpensive Depth sensor devices, hand gesture tracking has become again one topic of great interest. The problems to face respect other tracking algorithms are mainly two: the high complexity of the hand structure which translate in a very large amount of possible gestures, and the rapidness of the movements we are able to make when moving the hand or just the fingers. Recent approaches try to fit a 3D hand model to the observed RGB-D data by an optimization function that minimizes the error between the model and the data. However, these algorithms are very dependent of the initialization point, being unpractical to run in a natural environment. To solve these kind of problems, it is common to use an offline dataset with pre-learnt gestures that will serve as a first rough estimate. In concrete, we present an algorithm that uses an articulated ICP minimization function, that is initialized by the parameters obtained from a dataset of hand gestures trained through deep learning framework. This set up has two strong points. First, deep learning provides a very fast and accurate estimate of performed hand gesture. Second, the articulated ICP algorithm allows to capture the possible variability of a gesture performed by different person or slightly different gesture. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated and validated in several ways. Independent evaluations for deep learning framework and articulated ICP are performed. Moreover, different real sequences are recorded to validate our approach, and finally quantitative and qualitative comparisons are conducted with state-of-the-art algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Embedding methods have shown promising performance in multilabel prediction, as they are able to discover the label dependence. However, most methods ignore the correlations between the input and output, such that their learned embeddings are not well aligned, which leads to degradation in prediction performance. This paper presents a formulation for multilabel learning, from the perspective of cross-view learning, that explores the correlations between the input and the output. The proposed method, called Co-Embedding (CoE), jointly learns a semantic common subspace and view-specific mappings within one framework. The semantic similarity structure among the embeddings is further preserved, ensuring that close embeddings share similar labels. Additionally, CoE conducts multilabel prediction through the cross-view k nearest neighborhood (kNN) search among the learned embeddings, which significantly reduces computational costs compared with conventional decoding schemes. A hashing-based model, i.e., Co-Hashing (CoH), is further proposed. CoH is based on CoE, and imposes the binary constraint on continuous latent embeddings. CoH aims to generate compact binary representations to improve the prediction efficiency by benefiting from the efficient kNN search of multiple labels in the Hamming space. Extensive experiments on various real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the state of the arts in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many practical applications such as gene expression analysis, multitask learning, image recognition, signal processing, and medical data analysis pursue a sparse solution for the feature selection purpose and particularly favor the nonzeros evenly distributed in different groups. The exclusive sparsity norm has been widely used to serve to this purpose. However, it still lacks systematical studies for exclusive sparsity norm optimization. This paper offers two main contributions from the optimization perspective: 1) we provide several efficient algorithms to solve exclusive sparsity norm minimization with either smooth loss or hinge loss (nonsmooth loss). All algorithms achieve the optimal convergence rate O(1/k&amp;#x00B2;). (k is the iteration number.) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to guarantee such convergence rate for the general exclusive sparsity norm minimization and 2) when the group information is unavailable to define the exclusive sparsity norm, we propose to use the random grouping scheme to construct groups and prove that if the number of groups is appropriately chosen, the nonzeros (true features) would be grouped in the ideal way with high probability. Empirical studies validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, and the effectiveness of random grouping scheme on the proposed exclusive support vector machine formulation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Information age is a recently introduced metric to represent the freshness of information in communication systems. We investigate age minimization in a wireless network and propose a novel approach of optimizing the scheduling strategy to deliver all messages as fresh as possible. Specifically, we consider a set of links that share a common channel. The transmitter at each link contains a given number of packets with time stamps from an information source that generated them. We address the link transmission scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the overall age. This minimum age scheduling problem (MASP) is different from minimizing the time or the delay for delivering the packets in question. We model the MASP mathematically and prove it is NP-hard in general. We also identify tractable cases as well as optimality conditions. An integer linear programming formulation is provided for performance benchmarking. Moreover, a steepest age descent algorithm with better scalability is developed. Numerical study shows that, by employing the optimal schedule, the overall age is significantly reduced in comparison to other scheduling strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Given a trajectory database and a pair of upstream and downstream spatio-temporal (ST) regions (i.e., spatial area coupled with a time interval), a TTA query aims to retrieve the total number of unique trajectories that traverse through these two ST regions. Such TTA queries play an important role in various urban applications, such as route planning, taxi dispatching, and location-based advertising. Exact search (over the entire ST query regions) can obtain the exact answer but leading to high time cost when the ST query regions are huge. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Targeted Index Sampling (TIS) framework to answer TTA queries with high estimation accuracy. TIS employs a two-stage framework, with a Pilot Sampling Estimation (PSE) stage to estimate the distribution of trajectories in ST query region, and an Integrated Importance Sampling (IIS) stage, which collects trajectories with the importance sampling distribution obtained in PSE, and estimates the query result with an asymptotically unbiased estimator. Extensive experiments and case studies using a large-scale real taxi trajectory dataset from Shenzhen, China demonstrate that our TIS framework achieves &amp;#x2264;10% estimation error with &amp;#x2265;90% computational time reduction (with similar running time) over exact search.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The emergence of smart Wi-Fi APs (Access Point), which are equipped with huge storage space, opens a new research area on how to utilize these resources at the edge network to improve users&amp;#x2019; quality of experience (QoE) (e.g., a short startup delay and smooth playback). One important research interest in this area is content prefetching, which predicts and accurately fetches contents ahead of users&amp;#x2019; requests to shift the traffic away during peak periods. However, in practice, the different video watching patterns among users, and the varying network connection status lead to the time-varying server load, which eventually makes the content prefetching problem challenging. To understand this challenge, this paper first performs a large-scale measurement study on users&amp;#x2019; AP connection and TV series watching patterns using real-traces. Then, based on the obtained insights, we formulate the content prefetching problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The objective is to strike a balance between the increased prefetching&amp;storage cost incurred by incorrect prediction and the reduced content download delay because of successful prediction. A learning-based approach is proposed to solve this problem and another three algorithms are adopted as baselines. In particular, first, we investigate the performance lower bound by using a random algorithm, and the upper bound by using an ideal offline approach. Then, we present a heuristic algorithm as another baseline. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm that is more practical to work in the online manner. Through extensive trace-based experiments, we demonstrate the performance gain of our design. Remarkably, our learning-based algorithm achieves a better precision and hit ratio (e.g., 80%) with about 70% (resp. 50%) cost saving compared to the random (resp. heuristic) algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>There has been significant interest in the development of anonymization schemes for publishing graph data. However, privacy is a major concern in dealing with graph data. In this paper, an integrated framework for ensuring privacy in the presence of an authorization mechanism is proposed. Access control mechanisms provide additional safeguard against data breaches and ensure that only authorized information is available to end-users based on their assigned roles. The integrated framework highlights a tradeoff between privacy and authorized privileges. To attain a pre-specified privacy level, access privileges might need to be relaxed. For the proposed framework, we formulate the k-anonymous Bi-objective Graph Partitioning (k-BGP) problem and provide its hardness results. Heuristics solutions are developed to solve the constraint problem. The framework provides an anonymous view based on the target class of role-based workloads for graph data. The proposed heuristics are empirically evaluated and a detailed security analysis of the framework in terms of risk associated with re-identification attack is conducted.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Accurately recognizing sophisticated sceneries from a rich variety of semantic categories is an indispensable component in many intelligent systems, e.g., scene parsing, video surveillance, and autonomous driving. Recently, there have emerged a large quantity of deep architectures for scene categorization, wherein promising performance has been achieved. However, these models cannot explicitly encode human visual perception toward different sceneries, i.e., the sequence of humans sequentially allocates their gazes. To solve this problem, we propose deep gaze shifting kernel to distinguish sceneries from different categories. Specifically, we first project regions from each scenery into the so-called perceptual space, which is established by combining color, texture, and semantic features. Then, a novel non-negative matrix factorization algorithm is developed which decomposes the regions' feature matrix into the product of the basis matrix and the sparse codes. The sparse codes indicate the saliency level of different regions. In this way, the gaze shifting path from each scenery is derived and an aggregation-based convolutional neural network is designed accordingly to learn its deep representation. Finally, the deep representations of gaze shifting paths from all the scene images are incorporated into an image kernel, which is further fed into a kernel SVM for scene categorization. Comprehensive experiments on six scenery data sets have demonstrated the superiority of our method over a series of shallow/deep recognition models. Besides, eye tracking experiments have shown that our predicted gaze shifting paths are 94.6&amp;#x0025; consistent with the real human gaze allocations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Multipath networks have been extensively studied to improve throughput and alleviate network congestion. However, multipath networks, with the exception of equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) networks, are difficult to implement because they schedule network resources at cross layers and require complex signaling mechanisms to monitor network status (e.g., round trip time, bandwidths and link state). Virtualization, in contrast, provides network isolation with protocols and resources and simplifies the process of coupling the interaction between signaling mechanisms, which makes multipath implementation practical. This paper proposes a multipath network virtualization scheme that implements software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). Multipath networks can be deployed in the virtualized environment. The proposed scheme attains a summary of network resources, such as network topology and link bandwidth, and can schedule these resources for selecting and spreading flow over multiple paths. Additionally, virtualization provides computing and storage resources for flow splitting, tag adding and packet reordering, among other applications. Specifically, the tags are designed for forwarding and packet reordering. Our experiment builds the platform based on Open Platform for NFV and SDN on the practice testbed. To verify its functionalities, we first evaluate the overhead of each component, and then implement and compare five state-of-the-art multipath models on the proposed platform. Our scheme is compatible with these multipath models. Moreover, the experimental results show that the model with flow splitting has superior performance with respect to load balancing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The lack of a large, natural emotional database is one of the key barriers to translate results on speech emotion recognition in controlled conditions into real-life applications. Collecting emotional databases is expensive and time demanding, which limits the size of existing corpora. Current approaches used to collect spontaneous databases tend to provide unbalanced emotional content, which is dictated by the given recording protocol (e.g., positive for colloquial conversations, negative for discussion or debates). The size and speaker diversity are also limited. This paper proposes a novel approach to effectively build a large, naturalistic emotional database with balanced emotional content, reduced cost and reduced manual labor. It relies on existing spontaneous recordings obtained from audio-sharing websites. The proposed approach combines machine learning algorithms to retrieve recordings conveying balanced emotional content with a cost effective annotation process using crowdsourcing, which make it possible to build a large scale speech emotional database. This approach provides natural emotional renditions from multiple speakers, with different channel conditions and conveying balanced emotional content that are difficult to obtain with alternative data collection protocols.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social networks are critical in terms of information or malware propagation. However, how to contain the spreading of malware in social networks is still an open and challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel defending method through big data based influence modeling. We first establish a social interaction graph based on big data sets of the studied object. Based on the graph, we are able to measure direct influence of individuals by computing each node&amp;#x0027;s strength, which includes the degree of the node and the total number of messages sent by each user to her friends. Then, we design an algorithm to construct influence spreading tree using the breadth first search strategy, and measure indirect influence of individuals by traversing the tree. We identify the top k influential nodes among all the nodes via the social influence strength, and propose an immunization algorithm to defend social networks against various attacks. The extensive experiments show that influence can spread easily in social networks, and the greater the influence of initial spread node is, the more impact it is on the malware propagation in social networks. The proposed method provides an effective solution to the prevention of malware or malicious messages propagation in social networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We propose a hybrid digital-analog (HDA) framework for wireless video transmission, which benefits from both the high distortion-power performance of digital systems and the graceful performance degradation of analog systems. The proposed framework models video frames as a parallel Gaussian source, which is separated into digital and analog parts through scalar quantization. It features entropy coding and channel coding in digital transmission and power scaling in analog transmission. The key challenge in this framework is how to allocate the constrained power and bandwidth resources between and among digital and analog components to achieve minimal distortion at the receiver. Given the worst-case CSNR, we are able to derive a closed-form expression of the overall distortion. However, minimizing it is a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem which is generally NP-hard. By making reasonable and justified simplifications, we approach the optimal solution through a practical scheme. Evaluations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art analog scheme SoftCast by a large margin. The gain in received video PSNR is up to 5.0dB for various types of videos.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Although the concept of user experience includes two key aspects, experience of meaning (usability) and experience of emotion (affect), the empirical work that measures both the usability and affective aspects of user experience is currently limited. This is particularly important considering that affect could significantly influence a user&amp;#x2019;s perception of usability. This paper uses image schemas to quantitatively and systematically evaluate both these aspects. It proposes a method for evaluating user experience that is based on using image schemas, sentiment analysis, and computational semantics. The aim is to link the sentiments expressed by users during their interactions with a product to the specific image schemas used in the designs. The method involves semantic and sentiment analysis of the verbal responses of the users to identify (i) task-related words linked to the task for which a certain image schema has been used and (ii) affect-related words associated with the image schema employed in the interaction. The main contribution is in linking image schemas with interaction and affect. The originality of the method is twofold. First, it uses a domain-specific ontology of image schemas specifically developed for the needs of this study. Second, it employs a novel ontology-based algorithm that extracts the image schemas employed by the user to complete a specific task and identifies and links the sentiments expressed by the user with the specific image schemas used in the task. The proposed method is evaluated using a case study involving 40 participants who completed a set task with two different products. The results show that the method successfully links the users&amp;#x2019; experiences to the specific image schemas employed to complete the task. This method facilitates significant improvements in product design practices and usability studies in particular, as it allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation of designs by ide- tifying specific image schemas and product design features that have been positively or negatively received by the users. This allows user experience to be assessed in a systematic way, which leads to a better understanding of the value associated with particular design features.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. Still, enrolment rates in STEM degrees are low in many European countries and consequently there is a lack of adequately educated workforce in industries. We believe that this can be mainly attributed to pedagogical issues, such as the lack of engaging hands-on activities utilized for science and math education in middle and high schools. In this paper, we report our work in the SciChallenge European project, which aims at increasing the interest of pre-university students in STEM disciplines, through its distinguishing feature, the systematic use of social media for providing and evaluation of the student-generated content. A social media-aware contest and platform were thus developed and tested in a pan-European contest that attracted &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$&amp;#x003E;700$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; participants. The statistical analysis and results revealed that the platform and contest positively influenced participants STEM learning and motivation, while only the gender factor for the younger study group appeared to affect the outcomes (confidence level &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$- p&amp;lt;.05$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Person re-identification plays an important role in many safety-critical applications. Existing works mainly focus on extracting patch-level features or learning distance metrics. However, the representation power of extracted features might be limited, due to the various viewing conditions of pedestrian images in complex real-world scenarios. To improve the representation power of features, we learn discriminative and robust representations via dictionary learning in this paper. First, we propose a Cross-view Dictionary Learning (CDL) model, which is a general solution to the multi-view learning problem. Inspired by the dictionary learning based domain adaptation, CDL learns a pair of dictionaries from two views. In particular, CDL adopts a projective learning strategy, which is more efficient than the &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$l_{1}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; optimization in traditional dictionary learning. Second, we propose a Cross-view Multi-level Dictionary Learning (CMDL) approach based on CDL. CMDL contains dictionary learning models at different representation levels, including image-level, horizontal part-level, and patch-level. The proposed models take advantages of the view-consistency information, and adaptively learn pairs of dictionaries to generate robust and compact representations for pedestrian images. Third, we incorporate a discriminative regularization term to CMDL, and propose a CMDL-Dis approach which learns pairs of discriminative dictionaries in image-level and part-level. We devise efficient optimization algorithms to solve the proposed models. Finally, a fusion strategy is utilized to generate the similarity scores for test images. Experiments on the public VIPeR, CUHK Campus, iLIDS, GRID and PRID450S datasets show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>During software development and maintenance, developers spend a considerable amount of time on program comprehension activities. Previous studies show that program comprehension takes up as much as half of a developer&amp;#x0027;s time. However, most of these studies are performed in a controlled setting, or with a small number of participants, and investigate the program comprehension activities only within the IDEs. However, developers&amp;#x0027; program comprehension activities go well beyond their IDE interactions. In this paper, we extend our ActivitySpace framework to collect and analyze Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) data across many applications (not just the IDEs). We follow Minelli et al.&amp;#x0027;s approach to assign developers&amp;#x0027; activities into four categories: navigation, editing, comprehension, and other. We then measure the comprehension time by calculating the time that developers spend on program comprehension, e.g. inspecting console and breakpoints in IDE, or reading and understanding tutorials in web browsers. Using this approach, we can perform a more realistic investigation of program comprehension activities, through a field study of program comprehension in practice across a total of seven real projects, on 78 professional developers, and amounting to 3,148 working hours. Our study leverages interaction data that is collected across many applications by the developers. Our study finds that on average developers spend &amp;#x223C;58% of their time on program comprehension activities, and that they frequently use web browsers and document editors to perform program comprehension activities. We also investigate the impact of programming language, developers&amp;#x0027; experience, and project phase on the time that is spent on program comprehension, and we find senior developers spend significantly less percentages of time on program comprehension than junior developers. Our study a- so highlights the importance of several research directions needed to reduce program comprehension time, e.g., building automatic detection and improvement of low quality code and documentation, construction of software-engineering-specific search engines, designing better IDEs that help developers navigate code and browse information more efficiently, etc.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Analyzing social streams is important for many applications, such as crisis management. However, the considerable diversity, increasing volume, and high dynamics of social streams of large events continue to be significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure effective exploration. We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Online advertising delivers promotional marketing messages to consumers through online media. Advertisers often have the desire to optimize their advertising spending strategies in order to gain the highest return on investment and maximize their key performance indicator. To build accurate advertisement performance predictive models, it is crucial to detect the change-points in the historical data and apply appropriate strategies to address a data pattern shift problem. However, with sparse data, which is common in online advertising and some other applications, online change-point detection is very challenging. We present a novel collaborated online change-point detection method in this paper. Through efficiently leveraging and coordinating with auxiliary time series, we can quickly and accurately identify the change-points in sparse and noisy time series. Simulation studies as well as real data experiments have justified the proposed method's effectiveness in detecting change-points in sparse time series. Therefore, it can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the popularity of mobile devices and the development of the wireless technologies, humans can be connected ubiquitously. Because of the mobility of the devices, it is a hard task to maintain the end-to-end path between source node and destination node. Researchers have introduced analysis of nodes&amp;#x2019; social behavior to solve the problem of data dissemination in the networks, which leads to the emersion of the Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). They increase the performance of data forwarding by the social relationships and interactions among nodes. Many schemes and algorithms have been proposed to enhance data forwarding performance and provide humanized service by introducing social features and digging social properties. In this paper, first, we investigate the architectures and evolutionary process of the MSNs. Then, the social features of nodes existing in the MSNs and main social properties of MSNs are described. In term of the state-of-the-art works, data forwarding strategies in the MSNs are divided into four categories, including only encounter history-based strategies, social-based strategies, incentive mechanisms, and forwarding methods that take social selfishness into consideration of this paper. Finally, the major issues and challenges are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Organizing webpages into interesting topics is one of the key steps to understand the trends from multimodal Web data. The sparse, noisy, and less-constrained user-generated content results in inefficient feature representations. These descriptors unavoidably cause that a detected topic still contains a certain number of the false detected webpages, which further make a topic be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. In this paper, we address this problem from a viewpoint interpreting a topic by its prototypes, and present a two-step approach to achieve this goal. Following the detection-by-ranking approach, a sparse Poisson deconvolution is proposed to learn the intratopic similarities between webpages. To find the prototypes, leveraging the intratopic similarities, top-k diverse yet representative prototype webpages are identified from a submodularity function. Experimental results not only show the improved accuracies for the Web topic detection task, but also increase the interpretation of a topic by its prototypes on two public datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the past few years, cloud computing develops very quickly. A large amount of data are uploaded and stored in remote public cloud servers which cannot fully be trusted by users. Especially, more and more enterprises would like to manage their data by the aid of the cloud servers. However, when the data outsourced in the cloud are sensitive, the challenges of security and privacy becomes urgent for wide deployment of the cloud systems. This paper proposes a secure data sharing scheme to ensure the privacy of data owner and the security of the outsourced cloud data. The proposed scheme provides flexible utility of data while solving the privacy and security challenges for data sharing. The security and efficiency analysis demonstrate that the designed scheme is feasible and efficient. At last, we discuss its application in E-health (electronic health) record.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Biometrics traits such as faces, fingerprints, and irises, are becoming prevalent in computer security applications: from authentication systems to identification systems. Given the sensitive nature of biometrics, a great deal of effort is put into protecting the biometric data after it is acquired - from secure sketch and fuzzy extractors to the use of secure multiparty computations (in protocols such as SCiFI or GSHADE). While these solutions make sure that the extracted values (e.g., binary strings or vectors) that correspond to the biometrics are kept privately and securely, their practical implementations are not optimal with respect to privacy guarantees in the process of extracting the information from the raw biometric data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The capability to perform identity re-identification in a crowd (e.g. from video feeds from a network of cameras, and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram) efficiently and effectively is increasingly important, as evident in recent real-world events (e.g. terrorist attacks on places of mass gatherings in different countries). However, real-time re-identification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g. social media platforms and multi-cameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent Residual Neural Network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation (MKDE) matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity re-identification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity re-identification. Evaluations using mixed datasets in real-time demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a 2.6% accuracy over other state-of-the-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Under IEEE 802.11p based Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) modules, vehicular safety applications rely on periodical broadcasts of safety beacons by each vehicle. However, the channel can be easily congested by high-frequency periodic beacons when the vehicle density becomes heavy. In this paper, through real-trace based empirical study on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, we find that non-line-of-sight (NLoS) condition is the key factor on link performance degradation and blindly sending more packets in harsh NLoS conditions can hardly succeed but increase interferences to neighboring vehicles. Inspired by this, we propose a distributed beacon congestion control scheme, named DBCC, to control beacon activities with considering link conditions, i.e., vehicles with more neighbors and better conditions of links with its neighbors, will be assigned with higher beacon rates. In DBCC, we first utilize two machine learning methods, i.e., Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to train the features and output a classifier model which conducts online NLoS link condition prediction. With link status information, we then formulate a link-weighted safety benefit maximization (L-SBM) problem of the rate-adaptation under a TDMA broadcast MAC, which is proved to be NP-hard. A greedy heuristic algorithm for L-SBM is then proposed and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated. Extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficiency of DBCC design; particularly, the rate of beacon transmissions can be effectively controlled without exceeding the resource limit and the rate of transmission/reception collisions are greatly reduced.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The world is experiencing an unprecedented, enduring, and pervasive aging process. With more people who need walking assistance, the demand for lower-extremity gait rehabilitation has increased rapidly over the years. The current clinical gait rehabilitative training requires heavy involvement of both medical doctors and physical therapists and thus are labor-intensive, subjective and expensive. To address these problems, advanced automation techniques, especially along with the proliferation of smart sensing and actuation devices and big data analytics platforms, have been introduced into this field to make the gait rehabilitation convenient, efficient, and personalized. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review on recent technological advances in wearable sensors, biofeedback devices and assistive robots. Empowered by the emerging networking and computing technologies in the big data era, these devices are interconnected into smart and connected rehabilitation systems to provide non-intrusive and continuous monitoring of physical and neurological conditions of the patients, perform complex gait analysis and diagnosis, and allow real-time decision making, biofeedback, and control of assistive robots. For each technology category, a detailed comparison among the existing solutions is provided. A thorough discussion is presented on remaining open problems and future directions to further improve the safety, efficiency and usability of the technologies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cloud computing is a suitable platform to execute the deadline-constrained scientific workflows which are typical big data applications and often require many hours to finish. Moreover, the problem of energy consumption has become one of the major concerns in clouds. In this paper, we present a cost and energy aware scheduling (CEAS) algorithm for cloud scheduler to minimize the execution cost of workflow and reduce the energy consumption while meeting the deadline constraint. The CEAS algorithm consists of five sub-algorithms. First, we use the VM selection algorithm which applies the concept of cost utility to map tasks to their optimal virtual machine (VM) types by the sub-makespan constraint. Then, two tasks merging methods are employed to reduce execution cost and energy consumption of workflow. Further, In order to reuse the idle VM instances which have been leased, the VM reuse policy is also proposed. Finally, the scheme of slack time reclamation is utilized to save energy of leased VM instances. According to the time complexity analysis, we conclude that the time complexity of each sub-algorithm is polynomial. The CEAS algorithm is evaluated using Cloudsim and four real-world scientific workflow applications, which demonstrates that it outperforms the related well-known approaches</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Community network (CN) initiatives have been around for roughly two decades, evangelizing a distinctly different paradigm for building, maintaining, and sharing network infrastructure but also defending the basic human right to Internet access. Over this time they have evolved into a mosaic of systems that vary widely with respect to their network technologies, their offered services, their organizational structure, and the way they position themselves in the overall telecommunications&amp;#x2019; ecosystem. Common to all these highly differentiated initiatives is the sustainability challenge. We approach sustainability as a broad term with an economical, political, and cultural context. We first review the different perceptions of the term. These vary both across and within the different types of stakeholders involved in CNs and are reflected in their motivation to join such initiatives. Then, we study the diverse approaches of CN operators towards the sustainability goal. Given the rich context of the term, these range all the way from mechanisms to fund their activities, to organizational structures and social activities serving as incentives for the engagement of their members. We iterate on incentive mechanisms that have been proposed and theoretically analyzed in the literature for CNs as well as tools and processes that have been actually implemented in them. Finally, we enumerate lessons that have been learned out of these two decades of CNs&amp;#x2019; operation and discuss additional technological and regulatory issues that are key to their longer-term sustainability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We develop a novel framework, named as l-injection, to address the sparsity problem of recommender systems. By carefully injecting low values to a selected set of unrated user-item pairs in a user-item matrix, we demonstrate that top-N recommendation accuracies of various collaborative filtering (CF) techniques can be significantly and consistently improved. We first adopt the notion of pre-use preferences of users toward a vast amount of unrated items. Using this notion, we identify uninteresting items that have not been rated yet but are likely to receive low ratings from users, and selectively impute them as low values. As our proposed approach is method-agnostic, it can be easily applied to a variety of CF algorithms. Through comprehensive experiments with three real-life datasets (e.g., Movielens, Ciao, and Watcha), we demonstrate that our solution consistently and universally enhances the accuracies of existing CF algorithms (e.g., item-based CF, SVD-based CF, and SVD++) by 2.5 to 5 times on average. Furthermore, our solution improves the running time of those CF methods by 1.2 to 2.3 times when its setting produces the best accuracy. The datasets and codes that we used in the experiments are available at: https://goo.gl/KUrmip.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Linguistic computational techniques based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) have been swiftly advanced on various fronts during the past five years. However, one of the key issues in the existing theoretical developments is that modeling possibility distribution-based semantics involves a relatively strict constraint that linguistic terms are uniformly distributed across an HFLTS. Releasing the constraint of uniform HFLTS through which individual semantics could be customized is challenging yet intriguing for participants interested in this topic. Comparative linguistic terms (CLEs) generated from context-free grammar facilitate flexible and accurate linguistic elicitation, and in consideration of computational simplicity they are transformed into HFLTSs which are machine manipulatable. It is imperative that the precision of customized individual semantics can be significantly improved in respect of different CLEs. This study proposes a novel possibility computation structure for HFLTS possibility distributions based on the linguistic terms similarity measure. The uniquely established linguistic terms in each and every CLE are initially treated as referential items for comparison. Then, possibilities of linguistic terms in a transformed HFLTS can be calculated as their similarity degrees to the predetermined referential item. Subsequently, the Interweaving method, in which a consistent Inner Interweaving Matrix needs to be constructed, is adopted to adapt Attitudinal Character to attain appealing degrees characterized in the unit interval. The generated attitudinal HFLTS possibility distributions provide a solution to the problem of modeling individually the semantic implications of CLEs. Several illustrative examples and comparative analyses further demonstrate that individual semantics endowed with Attitudinal Character model efficiently individual differences in cognitive styles.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper introduces a cognitive architecture for a humanoid robot to engage in a proactive, mixed-initiative exploration and manipulation of its environment, where the initiative can originate from both the human and the robot. The framework, based on a biologically-grounded theory of the brain and mind, integrates a reactive interaction engine, a number of state-of-the art perceptual and motor learning algorithms, as well as planning abilities and an autobiographical memory. The architecture as a whole drives the robot behavior to solve the symbol grounding problem, acquire language capabilities, execute goal-oriented behavior, and express a verbal narrative of its own experience in the world. We validate our approach in human-robot interaction experiments with the iCub humanoid robot, showing that the proposed cognitive architecture can be applied in real time within a realistic scenario and that it can be used with naive users.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The smart campus can monitor students in real time by analyzing students&amp;#x2019; images, but a large number of images bring an unbearable burden to the smart campus. The convenience of cloud computing has attracted smart campus to outsource their huge amount of data to cloud servers. Although the outsourcing of data can reduce the computational and storage burden on smart campus, the privacy preserving becomes the biggest concern. This issue has attracted many researchers to study the protection of outsourced multimedia data. In this paper, we propose an effective and practical privacy-preserving computation outsourcing protocol for the local binary pattern (LBP) feature over huge encrypted images. The image owner uploads the encrypted version of images to the cloud. The cloud server takes the responsibility of extracting the LBP features from encrypted images for various applications. In the encryption process, an image is divided into non-overlapping blocks at first, and the blocks are shuffled to protect the image content. Next, all the non-center pixels in each block are shuffled. Finally, the pixels are encrypted by splitting the original image data randomly. When such an encrypted image is received, the cloud servers can calculate the LBP features by secure multiparty computation. The extracted features can be applied to many applications, such as texture classification, image retrieval, face recognition, and so on.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Person re-identification (re-id) is a critical problem in video analytics applications such as security and surveillance. The public release of several datasets and code for vision algorithms has facilitated rapid progress in this area over the last few years. However, directly comparing re-id algorithms reported in the literature has become difficult since a wide variety of features, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics are employed. In order to address this need, we present an extensive review and performance evaluation of single- and multi-shot re-id algorithms. The experimental protocol incorporates the most recent advances in both feature extraction and metric learning. To ensure a fair comparison, all of the approaches were implemented using a unified code library that includes 11 feature extraction algorithms and 22 metric learning and ranking techniques. All approaches were evaluated using a new large-scale dataset that closely mimics a real-world problem setting, in addition to 16 other publicly available datasets: VIPeR, GRID, CAVIAR, DukeMTMC4ReID, 3DPeS, PRID, V47, WARD, SAIVT-SoftBio, CUHK01, CHUK02, CUHK03, RAiD, iLIDSVID, HDA+ and Market1501. The evaluation codebase and results will be made publicly available for community use.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Energy crisis and carbon emission have become two seriously concerned issues universally. As a feasible solution, Energy Internet (EI) has aroused global concern once proposed. EI is a new power generation developing a vision of evolution of smart grids into the Internet. The communication infrastructure is an essential component to the implementation of EI. A scalable and permanent communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of EI. In this paper, we present an introduction and the motivation to the evolution from smart grid to EI. We also introduce a representative EI architecture, i.e., the future renewable electric energy delivery and management system. Four critical EI features are emphasized. Then, we summarize the essential requirements that EI systems have to meet. With several key supporting technologies, EI shall realize the optimal utilization of highly scalable and distributed green energy resources, so that the situation of severe energy source crisis and carbon emission can be efficiently relieved. Since an EI system might have extensively distributed consumers and devices, the guarantee of its reliability and security is extremely significant. The further specific exploration for challenges, including reliability and security, will be stated in this paper.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Video creation is a difficult and highly professional work, which usually needs massive manual operations. To ease the burden, a better way is to automatically produce new videos based on clips in massive existing videos in accordance with arbitrary text. In this work, we formulate the video creation as a problem of retrieving a sequence of videos for a sentence stream. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel multimodal recurrent video generation network for automatic video generation. Compared with existing methods, the proposed model has three major advantages. (1) It is a new end-to-end learning framework. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to address the problem of retrieving a sequence of videos for a sentence stream. (2) It can effectively exploit the correspondence between the sentences and the video clips through semantic consistence modeling. (3) It can model the visual coherence well by constraining that the generated videos should be organized coherently in visual appearances. We have conducted extensive experiments on two applications including video retrieval and video generation. Both qualitative and quantitative results on two public datasets used in the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge 2016 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Large volumes of networked streaming event data are becoming increasingly available in a wide variety of applications such as social network analysis, Internet traffic monitoring, and health care analytics. Streaming event data are discrete observations occurring in continuous time, and the precise time interval between two events carries substantial information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. How does one promptly detect changes in these dynamic systems using these streaming event data? In this paper, we propose a novel change-point detection framework for multidimensional event data over networks. We cast the problem into a sequential hypothesis test, and we derive the likelihood ratios for point processes, which are computed efficiently via an expectation-maximization (EM) like algorithm that is parameter free and can be computed in a distributed manner. We derive a highly accurate theoretical characterization of the falsealarm rate, and we show that the method can provide weak signal detection by aggregating local statistics over time and networks. Finally, we demonstrate the good performance of our algorithm on numerical examples and real-world datasets from Twitter and Memetracker.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The ability to accurately track pedestrians is valuable for variant application designs. Although pedestrian tracking has been investigated excessively and owned a well-suited sensing platform, the proposed solutions are far from being mature yet. Pedestrian tracking contains step counting and stride estimation two components. Step counting already has commercial products, but the performance is still unreliable and less trustworthy in practice. Stride estimation even stays in the research stage without ready solutions released on the market. Such a non-negligible gap between long-term research investigation and technique&amp;#x0027;s actual usage exists due to a series of crucial applicability issues unsolved, including design vulnerability to interfering activities, extracting purely body&amp;#x0027;s movement from additive sensor signals, and parameter training without user&amp;#x0027;s intervention. In this paper, we deeply analyze human&amp;#x0027;s gait cycles and obtain inspiring observations to address these issues. We incorporate our techniques into existing pedestrian tracking designs and implement a prototype, PTrack, using LG smartwatch. We find PTrack effectively enhances the system applicability and achieves promising performance under very practical settings.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>To fully empower sensor networks with cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) technology, efficient medium access control protocols that enable the coexistence of cognitive sensor networks with current wireless infrastructure are as essential as the cognitive power in data fusion and processing due to shared wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio (CR) is introduced to increase spectrum efficiency and support such an endeavor, which thereby becomes a promising building block toward facilitating cognitive IoT. In this paper, primary users (PUs) refer to devices in existing wireless infrastructure, and secondary users (SUs) refer to cognitive sensors. For interference control between PUs and SUs, SUs adopt dynamic spectrum access and power adjustment to ensure sufficient operation of PUs, which inevitably leads to increasing latency and poses new challenges on the reliability of IoT communications. To guarantee operations of primary systems while simultaneously optimizing system performance in cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs), this paper proposes interference-aware flooding schemes exploiting global timeout and vaccine recovery schemes to control the heavy buffer occupancy induced by packet replications. The information delivery dynamics of SUs under the proposed interference-aware recovery-assisted flooding schemes is analyzed via epidemic models and stochastic geometry from a macroscopic view of the entire system. The simulation results show that our model can efficiently capture the complicated data delivery dynamics in CRAHNs in terms of end-to-end transmission reliability and buffer occupancy. This paper sheds new light on analysis of recovery-assisted flooding schemes in CRAHNs and provides performance evaluation of cognitive IoT services built upon CRAHNs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The feeling of horror within movies or games relies on the audience&amp;#x2019;s perception of a tense atmosphere &amp;#x2014; often achieved through sound accompanied by the on-screen drama &amp;#x2014; guiding its emotional experience throughout the scene or game-play sequence. These progressions are often crafted through an a priori knowledge of how a scene or game-play sequence will playout, and the intended emotional patterns a game director wants to transmit. The appropriate design of sound becomes even more challenging once the scenery and the general context is autonomously generated by an algorithm. Towards realizing sound-based affective interaction in games this paper explores the creation of computational models capable of ranking short audio pieces based on crowdsourced annotations of tension, arousal and valence. Affect models are trained via preference learning on over a thousand annotations with the use of support vector machines, whose inputs are low-level features extracted from the audio assets of a comprehensive sound library. The models constructed in this work are able to predict the tension, arousal and valence elicited by sound with a 65% and 66%, 72% average accuracy over 5-fold validation, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the emergence of big data computing and analysis, cloud computing services become more and more popular, which has recently drawn researchers&amp;#x2019; great attentions to develop various new applications and mechanisms. In this paper, we consider the on-demand mechanism design in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS), including resource allocation and pricing issues under dynamic scenarios. Most of existing works on mechanism design assumed static and independent individual utility, while the cloud computing services are provided in a dynamic environment. To solve such problems, we start with analyzing the Google cluster-usage dataset to draw the statistical and stochastic characteristics of the IaaS consumers and providers. Based on the characteristics mined from real data, we propose a stochastic matching algorithm with Markov Decision Process (MDP), which aims at optimizing the long-term system efficiency, with its online version using Q-learning method to address the imperfect model estimation problem. We further design an efficient (EF), incentive compatible (IC), individual rational (IR) auction mechanism, which is an extension of traditional Vickrey-Clarke- Groves (VCG) mechanism. The proposed mechanism is studied under two application scenario: quality sensitive services, where unilateral MDP-VCG auction is implemented; and quality insensitive services, where MDP-VCG double auction is implemented. To verify the performance of our proposed mechanism, we conduct experiment using the Google dataset and show that the proposed MDP-based VCG auction mechanism can achieve EF, IC and IR properties simultaneously.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Sensors are widely used in modern mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, watches) and may gather information, including photos, sounds and locations, from environments as well as about users. However, the powerful sensing abilities provide opportunities for attackers to steal both personal sensitive data and commercial secrets. Unfortunately, the current design only provides a coarse access control on sensors and does not have the capability to audit sensing. In this paper, we firstly leverage a hook-based track method, where the processes of applications and Android system will be hooked to track sensor accesses. Thus, sensing operations will be intercepted and audited according to predefined audit policies. We implement a prototype referred to as senDroid, which visually shows the quantitative usage of these sensors in real time at a performance overhead of [0.04--8.05]%. senDroid allows Android users to audit the applications in real time. Our empirical study on 1,489 popular apps shows that 26.32% apps access sensors when the apps are launched, and 11.01% apps access sensors while the apps run in the background. Our reverse-engineering shows that 77.27% apps access sensors via third-party libraries, but such access rarely appears in the apps&amp;#x0027; descriptions, which calls for attention to sensor access to address the users&amp;#x0027; privacy concerns.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>As an emerging research topic, online class imbalance learning often combines the challenges of both class imbalance and concept drift. It deals with data streams having very skewed class distributions, where concept drift may occur. It has recently received increased research attention; however, very little work addresses the combined problem where both class imbalance and concept drift coexist. As the first systematic study of handling concept drift in class-imbalanced data streams, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of current research progress in this field, including current research focuses and open challenges. Then, an in-depth experimental study is performed, with the goal of understanding how to best overcome concept drift in online learning with class imbalance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Emerging wireless networks have brought Internet and communications to more users and areas. Some of the most relevant emerging wireless technologies are WiMAX, LTE-A, adhoc and mesh networks. An open challenge is to ensure the reliability and robustness of these networks when individual components fail. The survivability and performance of these networks can be especially relevant when emergencies arise in rural areas, for example supporting communications during a medical emergency. This can be done by anticipating failures and finding alternative solutions. This paper proposes using big data analytics techniques such as decision trees for detecting nodes that are likely to fail, and so avoid them when routing traffic. This can improve the survivability and performance of networks. The current approach is illustrated with an agentbased simulator of wireless networks developed with NetLogo and data mining processes designed with RapidMiner.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, many MapReduce applications consist of groups of jobs with dependencies among each other, such as iterative machine learning applications and large database queries. Unfortunately, the MapReduce framework is not optimized for these multi-job applications. It does not explore the execution overlapping opportunities among jobs and can only schedule jobs independently. These issues significantly inflate the application execution time. This paper presents PISCES (Pipeline Improvement Support with Critical chain Estimation Scheduling), a critical chain optimization (a critical chain refers to a series of jobs which will make the application run longer if any one of them is delayed), to provide better support for multi-job applications. PISCES extends the existing MapReduce framework to allow scheduling for multiple jobs with dependencies by dynamically building up a job dependency DAG for current running jobs according to their input and output directories. Then using the dependency DAG, it provides an innovative mechanism to facilitate the data pipelining between the output phase (map phase in the Map-Only job or reduce phase in the Map-Reduce job) of an upstream job and the map phase of a downstream job. This offers a new execution overlapping between dependent jobs in MapReduce which effectively reduces the application runtime. Moreover, PISCES proposes a novel critical chain job scheduling model based on the accurate critical chain estimation. Experiments show that PISCES can increase the degree of system parallelism by up to 68% and improve the execution speed of applications by up to 52%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Software Defined Networking (SDN) decouples the control plane from the data plane of forwarding devices. This separation provides several benefits, including the simplification of network management and control. However, due to a variety reasons, such as budget constraints and fear of downtime, many organizations are reluctant to fully deploy SDN. Partially deploying SDN through the placement of a limited number of SDN devices among legacy (traditional) network devices, forms a so-called hybrid SDN network. While hybrid SDN networks provide many of the benefits of SDN and have a wide range of applications, they also pose several challenges. These challenges have recently been addressed in a growing body of literature on hybrid SDN network structures and protocols. This article presents a comprehensive up-to-date survey of the research and development in the field of hybrid SDN networks. We have organized the survey into five main categories, namely hybrid SDN network deployment strategies, controllers for hybrid SDN networks, protocols for hybrid SDN network management, traffic engineering mechanisms for hybrid SDN networks, as well as testing, verification, and security mechanisms for hybrid SDN networks. We thoroughly survey the existing hybrid SDN network studies according to this taxonomy and identify gaps and limitations in the existing body of research. Based on the outcomes of the existing research studies as well as the identified gaps and limitations, we derive guidelines for future research on hybrid SDN networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>State-of-the-art systems in literature using wearables are not capable of distinguishing large number of fine-grained and/or complex human activities, which may appear similar but with vital differences in context. This paper has proposed a novel system, HuMAn, that recognizes and classifies complex at-home activities of human users with wearable sensing. HuMAn makes such classification feasible by leveraging selective multi-modal sensing from wearable, and enhances richness of sensed information for activity classification by further leveraging placement of wearables across multiple positions on human body. HuMAn system consists of the following components: (a) practical feature set extraction from specific multi-modal sensor suites; (b) novel two-level structured classification algorithm that improves accuracy by leveraging sensors in multiple body positions; and (c) refinement in classification of complex activities with minimal external infrastructure support. The system is evaluated with 10 users in real home environments. Experimental results demonstrate that HuMAn can detect total 21 complex at-home activities with high degree of accuracy. For same-user evaluations (data split from same user), the average activity classification accuracy for 10-fold cross-validation is as high as 95% over the 21 activities and for cross-user evaluations, the average classification accuracy for 10-fold cross-validation is 92% and leave-one-out cross-validation is 75%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with two objectives, where one of the objectives dominates the other objective. Unlike single-objective MAB problems in which the learner obtains a random scalar reward for each arm it selects, in the proposed problem, the learner obtains a random reward vector, where each component of the reward vector corresponds to one of the objectives and the distribution of the reward depends on the context that is provided to the learner at the beginning of each round. We call this problem contextual multi-armed bandit with a dominant objective (CMAB-DO). In CMAB-DO, the goal of the learner is to maximize its total reward in the non-dominant objective while ensuring that it maximizes its total reward in the dominant objective. In this case, the optimal arm given a context is the one that maximizes the expected reward in the non-dominant objective among all arms that maximize the expected reward in the dominant objective. First, we show that the optimal arm lies in the Pareto front. Then, we propose the multi-objective contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm (MOC-MAB), and define two performance measures: the 2-dimensional (2D) regret and the Pareto regret. We show that both the 2D regret and the Pareto regret of MOC-MAB are sublinear in the number of rounds. We also compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods in synthetic and real-world datasets. The proposed model and the algorithm have a wide range of real-world applications that involve multiple and possibly conflicting objectives ranging from wireless communication to medical diagnosis and recommender systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the continuous development of smart grid and further restructuring of power industry, modern power systems have been transformed to complex cyber-physical systems char-acterized with high renewable energy penetrations, distributed facilities, advanced metering and communication technologies, as well as ever-increasing customer awareness. These new develop-ment trends pose significant challenges for electricity retailers and call for innovative decision-making methods. To help researchers and engineers have a better overview of the state-of-the-art on electricity retail decision-making schemes, this paper aims to survey the latest progress on this subject. Some critical and open issues in this field are also discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>There are numerous contexts where individuals typically consume a few items from a large selection of possible items. Examples include purchasing products, listening to music, visiting locations in physical or virtual environments, and so on. There has been significant prior work in such contexts on developing predictive modeling techniques for recommending new items to individuals, often using techniques such as matrix factorization. There are many situations, however, where making predictions for both previously-consumed and new items for an individual is important, rather than just recommending new items. We investigate this problem and find that widely-used matrix factorization methods are limited in their ability to capture important details in historical behavior, resulting in relatively low predictive accuracy for these types of problems. As an alternative we propose an interpretable and scalable mixture model framework that balances individual preferences in terms of exploration and exploitation. We evaluate our model in terms of accuracy in user consumption predictions using several real-world datasets, including location data, social media data, and music listening data. Experimental results show that the mixture model approach is systematically more accurate and more efficient for these problems compared to a variety of state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social media has become a major source for analyzing all aspects of daily life. Thanks to dedicated latent topic analysis methods such as the Ailment Topic Aspect Model (ATAM), public health can now be observed on Twitter. In this work, we are interested in using social media to monitor people&amp;#x0027;s health over time. The use of tweets has several benefits including instantaneous data availability at virtually no cost. Early monitoring of health data is complementary to post-factum studies and enables a range of applications such as measuring behavioral risk factors and triggering health campaigns. We formulate two problems: health transition detection and health transition prediction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Community detection is a crucial and essential problem in the structure analytics of complex networks, which can help us understand and predict the characteristics and functions of complex networks. Many methods, ranging from the optimization-based algorithms to the heuristic-based algorithms, have been proposed for solving such a problem. Due to the inherent complexity of identifying network structure, how to design an effective algorithm with a higher accuracy and a lower computational cost still remains an open problem. Inspired by the computational capability and positive feedback mechanism in the wake of foraging process of Physarum, which is a large amoeba-like cell consisting of a dendritic network of tube-like pseudopodia, a general Physarum-based computational framework for community detection is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed framework, the inter-community edges can be identified from the intra-community edges in a network and the positive feedback of solving process in an algorithm can be further enhanced, which are used to improve the efficiency of original optimization-based and heuristic-based community detection algorithms, respectively. Some typical algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithm, and Markov clustering algorithm) and real-world datasets have been used to estimate the efficiency of our proposed computational framework. Experiments show that the algorithms optimized by Physarum-inspired computational framework perform better than the original ones, in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Moreover, a computational complexity analysis verifies the scalability of our framework.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this study, we developed an on-call-tutor system to facilitate peer-help activities. It was implemented in a face-to-face heterogeneous classroom with 119 students from different departments who were not familiar with each other. We carried out an experiment to explore whether our system is useful to facilitate peer-help activities and enhance student learning performance. Our results showed that, compared to students in the control group, those in the experimental group had more peer-help activities and better learning performance. Results also showed that students built their social network in which they interacted with each other and obtained/provided social support and useful knowledge for learning purpose. In addition, we found that usefulness of our system for learning was the main factor that influenced students willingness to build friendship in the social network with familiar/unfamiliar classmates and then communicate with them. Based on our results, we suggest employing the on-call-tutor system in a heterogeneously grouped classroom in order to facilitate peer-help activities, especially when students learn difficult subjects like computer software and are not acquainted with one another. Our system is useful for students, who experience learning difficulties, in requesting help and finding a tutor. With the assistance of our system, students can build the social network among classmates and communicate with each other in order to find/provide learning assistance and social support. As a result, student learning performance can be enhanced.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes three hierarchical levels of a competitive big-data market model. We consider that a service provider gathers data from multiple data sources and provides valuable information from refined data as a service to its customers. Under our approach, a service provider determines optimal data procurement from multiple data sources within its budget constraint. The multiple data sources follow the service provider&amp;#x2019;s action by independently submitting bidding prices to the service provider. Further, customers decide whether to subscribe or not based on the subscription fee, their willingness-to-pay, and the quality of the refined data. We study the economic benefits of such a market model by analyzing the hierarchical decision making procedures as a Stackelberg game. We show the existence and the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE), and the NE solution is given as a closed form. Finally, we reveal that the obtained unique equilibrium solution maximizes the payoff of all market participants.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Detecting shopping groups is gaining popularity as it enables various applications ranging from marketing to advertising. Existing methods exploit WiFi probe requests to detect shopping groups by identifying co-located customers. However, the probe request is prone to suffer from device heterogeneity which might pose a severe data sparseness problem. More importantly, we find that a certain amount of shopping groups would separate sometimes which makes traditional methods unreliable. In this paper, we propose a shopping group detection system using WiFi (SNOW). Instead of collecting probe requests, SNOW utilizes the WiFi data from smartphones associated with the deployed access points (APs). We could thus obtain data from different devices and even ensure a data granularity of seconds using Arping. Besides, we exploit an effective heuristic extracted from two observations of shopping group dynamics to improve the detection performance. First, the probability of group separation differs in diverse areas. Second, the proportion of group participation and individual engagement differs in different activities of the mall. Therefore, APs under which shopping groups appear more frequently and barely separate should contribute more in measuring customer similarity. Lastly, we represent the measured similarity into a matrix format and apply matrix factorization with a sparsity constraint to derive grouping results directly. According to our experiments in a large shopping mall, SNOW improves the detection performance of baseline approaches by 13.2% on average.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vision based event analysis plays a very critical role in automatically organizing user generated photos. It is difficult because of the following challenges. (1) Intra-class variation. Photos uploaded by users are sparsely sampled visual appearances of event over time. Thus, each photo may only capture a single object or scene of a specific complex event. (2) Inter-class confusion. Photos related to different events may contain similar objects or scenes. (3) For abnormal event, it has sample scarcity issue and only few samples can be used for event pattern learning. In this paper, by considering the photo taken time, we propose a novel structured event modeling (SEM) framework for event analysis by exploiting temporal information of visual features and event classes in photo sequence. More specifically, the temporal event patterns of the photo sequence and the relationship of different photos are learned jointly through deep neural networks (CNNs and RNNs) and conditional random field (CRF). We evaluate the proposed structured event modeling framework in two applications including the mutliclass event recognition and abnormal event discovery in photo sequence. The extensive experimental results on a public event recognition dataset and a collected abnormal event dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social relationships between humans and robots require both long term engagement and a feeling of believabilty or social presence towards the robot. It is our contention that music can provide the extended engagement that other open-ended interaction studies have failed to do, also, that in combination with the engaging musical interaction, the addition of simulated social behaviours is necessary to trigger this sense of believability or social presence. Building on previous studies with our robot drummer Mortimer that show including social behaviours can increase engagement and social presence, we present the results of a longitudinal study investigating the effect of extending weekly collocated musical improvisation sessions by making Mortimer an active member of the participant&amp;#x2019;s virtual social network. Although we found the effects of extending the relationship into the virtual world were less pronounced than results we have previously found by adding social modalties to human-robot musical interaction, interesting questions are raised about the interpretation of our automated behavioural metrics across different contexts. Further, we found repeated results of increasingly uninteruppted playing and notable differences in responses to online posts by Mortimer and posts by participant&amp;#x2019;s human friends.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid urbanization in China has corresponded with rapid economic development and beneficial transformations of society that have also exacerbated many sensitive urban problems. Several &amp;#x201C;ghost cities&amp;#x201D; have emerged due to the mismatch between the speed of expansion and the rationality of urban planning, especially when the extensive city construction goes far beyond the actual peoples&amp;#x2019; demands. This paper presents a novel method for investigating &amp;#x201C;ghost city&amp;#x201D; phenomenon based on multisource remotely sensed data. Three components are included. First, coarse-to-fine built-up area extraction and multiscale integration based on nighttime light Defense Meteorological Satellite Program operational linescan system imagery, Chinese land cover&amp;#x002F;use datasets and maximum green vegetation fraction product. Second, improved &amp;#x201C;ghost city&amp;#x201D; index (IGCI) construction and discrimination of &amp;#x201C;ghost city&amp;#x201D; phenomenon comprising the rate of land urbanization, the rate of population urbanization, and the intensity of nighttime light. Third, comparison and validation of the IGCI with the traditional &amp;#x201C;ghost city&amp;#x201D; index with respect to spatio-temporal distribution and the landscape pattern of &amp;#x201C;ghost city.&amp;#x201D; The proposed method was validated using entire districts in Ordos, China. Experimental results demonstrated that the IGCI takes advantages of the spatio-temporal variations of cities and the characteristics of &amp;#x201C;ghost city&amp;#x201D; phenomenon. This is also validated by means of the per capita housing construction area and the landscape expansion index, and showed that the urban construction land grows much faster than the population of Ordos. With respect to the accuracy and distribution of spatial p- tterns, the obtained experimental results exhibit good consistency with results from previous statistical studies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Accurate high-temperature measurement is very important for process monitoring of an industrial system. Infrared thermometers usually can handle no more than 1000 &amp;#x00B0;C and should use some expensive accessories for higher temperature measurements. This paper proposes a low-cost pyrometry system with nonlinear multisense partial least squares (NMSPLS). The ordinary camera with different filters is designed to collect the images of hot object at different wavelengths, and the NMSPLS is presented for predicting the temperature of the hot object from the obtained images. For the proposed method, the obtained images are represented by the multisense tensor, where red, green, and blue are regarded as three different dimensions in a sense of the tensor, respectively. The proposed method integrates an outer model and a nonlinear inner model. For the outer model, the independent variables and the dependent variables are projected into a low-dimensional common latent subspace. The weight matrices are calculated from the independent variables by the tucker decomposition, and the single value decomposition is adopted for extracting the latent variables (Lvs) based on the covariance between the independent variables and the dependent variables. For the nonlinear inner model, the neural network is adopted and the extracted Lvs are used as the input and the output of the neural network, respectively. Two real experiments are performed for estimating the proposed method. The experimental results verify that the proposed method can be applied for pyrometry and have higher effectiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Urban data is massive, heterogeneous, and spatio-temporal, posing a substantial challenge for visualization and analysis. In this paper, we design and implement a novel visual analytics approach, Visual Analyzer for Urban Data (VAUD), that supports the visualization, querying, and exploration of urban data. Our approach allows for cross-domain correlation from multiple data sources by leveraging spatial-temporal and social inter-connectedness features. Through our approach, the analyst is able to select, filter, aggregate across multiple data sources and extract information that would be hidden to a single data subset. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide case studies on a real urban dataset that contains the cyber-, physical-, and socialinformation of 14 million citizens over 22 days.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Objective: The objectives of this work is to develop and test the ability of a wearable physiological sensors system, based on ECG, EDA and EEG, to capture human stress and to assess whether the detected changes in physiological signals correlate with changes in salivary cortisol level, which is a reliable, objective biomarker of stress. Methods: 15 healthy participants, seven males and six females, mean age 40.8 &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$pm$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; 9.5 years, wore a set of three commercial sensors to record physiological signals during the Maastricht Acute Stress Test, an experimental protocol known to elicit robust physical and mental stress in humans. Salivary samples were collected throughout the different phases of the test. Statistical analysis was performed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. A correlation analysis between extracted physiological features and salivary cortisol levels was also performed. Results: 15 features extracted from heart rate variability, electrodermal and electroencephalography signals showed a high degree of significance in disentangling stress from a relaxed state. The classification algorithm, based on significant features, provided satisfactory outcomes with 86% accuracy. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the observed changes in physiological features were consistent with the trend of salivary cortisol levels (R2 = 0.714). Conclusion: The tested set of wearable sensors was able to successfully capture human stress and quantify stress level. Significance: The results of this pilot study may be useful in designing portable and remote control systems, such as medical devices used to turn on interventions and prevent stress consequences.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In spite of their effectiveness, learning environments often fail to engage users and end up under-used. Many studies show that gamification of learning environments can enhance learners&amp;#x0027; motivation to use learning environments. However, learners react differently to specific game mechanics and little is known about how to adapt gaming features to learners&amp;#x0027; profiles. In this paper, we propose a process for adapting gaming features based on a player model. This model is inspired from existing player typologies and types of gamification elements. Our approach is implemented in a learning environment with five different gaming features, and evaluated with 266 participants. The main results of this study show that, amongst the most engaged learners (i.e. learners who use the environment the longest), those with adapted gaming features spend significantly more time in the learning environment. Furthermore, learners with features that are not adapted have a higher level of amotivation. These results support the relevance of adapting gaming features to enhance learners&amp;#x0027; engagement, and provide cues on means to implement adaptation mechanisms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Worldwide, utilities are losing billions of dollars annually because of electricity theft. The detection of electricity theft has been a topic of research for decades. In this paper, we extend our prior work in the context of advanced metering infrastructures, wherein smart meters are compromised and made to under-report consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first study of meter fraud in the context of distributed energy resources (DERs). With an increased penetration of DERs in modern power grids, and with the decline in electricity prices, we show that there is incentive for electricity generators to over-report generation. We quantify the economic impact of cyber-attacks (on meters) that are optimal in that they maximize fraud while circumventing detectors. In doing so, we use consumption data from Ireland, solar generation data from the U.S. and Australia, and wind generation data from France.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Context: Software defect prediction (SDP) is an important challenge in the field of software engineering, hence much research work has been conducted, most notably through the use of machine learning algorithms. However, class-imbalance typified by few defective components and many non-defective ones is a common occurrence causing difficulties for these methods. Imbalanced learning aims to deal with this problem and has recently been deployed by some researchers, unfortunately with inconsistent results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Network measures derived from empirical observations are often poor estimators of the true structure of system as it is impossible to observe all components and all interactions in many real world complex systems. Here, we study attack robustness of complex networks with data missing caused by: 1) a uniform random sampling and 2) a nonuniform random sampling. By introducing the subgraph robustness problem, we develop analytically a framework to investigate robustness properties of the two types of subgraphs under random attacks, localized attacks, and targeted attacks. Interestingly, we find that the benchmark models, such as Erd&amp;#x0151;s-R&amp;#x00E9;nyi graphs, random regular networks, and scale-free networks possess distinct characteristic subgraph robustness features. We show that the network robustness depends on several factors including network topology, attack mode, sampling method and the amount of data missing, generalizing some well-known robustness principles of complex networks. Our results offer insight into the structural effect of missing data in networks and highlight the significance of understanding different sampling processes and their consequences on attack robustness, which may be instrumental in designing robust systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) creations include, amongst other, music, dance, singing, theatre, human skills and craftsmanship. These cultural expressions are usually transmitted orally and/or using gestures and are modified over a period of time, through a process of collective recreation. As the world becomes more interconnected and many different cultures come into contact, local communities run the risk of losing important elements of their ICH, while young people find it difficult to maintain the connection with the cultural heritage treasured by their elders. In this paper, we present a novel holistic approach for the safeguarding and transmission of ICH that goes beyond the mere digitization of ICH content. Based on multisensory technology for the capturing of ICH, the proposed approach enables the generation of completely novel cultural content. High-level semantics are extracted from the acquired data, enabling researchers to identify possible implicit or hidden correlations between different ICH expressions or interpretation styles and study the evolution of a specific ICH. This data, coupled with other cultural resources, is accessible through the i-Treasures Web-platform, which provides the means for supporting knowledge exchange between researchers as well as know-how transmission from ICH bearers to apprentices.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Privacy-preserving recommender systems have been an active research topic for many years. However, until today, it is still a challenge to design an ecient solution without involving a fully trusted third party or multiple semitrusted third parties. The key obstacle is the large underlying user populations (i.e. huge input size) in the systems. In this paper, we revisit the concept of friendship-based recommender systems, proposed by Jeckmans et al. and Tang and Wang. These solutions are very promising because recommendations are computed based on inputs from a very small subset of the overall user population (precisely, a user&amp;#x2019;s friends and some randomly chosen strangers). We first clarify the single prediction protocol and Top-n protocol by Tang and Wang, by correcting some flaws and improving the eciency of the single prediction protocol. We then design a decentralized single protocol by getting rid of the semi-honest service provider. In order to validate the designed protocols, we crawl Twitter and construct two datasets (FMT and 10-FMT) which are equipped with auxiliary friendship information. Based on 10-FMT and MovieLens 100k dataset with simulated friendships, we show that even if our protocols use a very small subset of the datasets, their accuracy can still be equal to or better than some baseline algorithm. Based on these datasets, we further demonstrate that the outputs of our protocols leak very small amount of information of the inputs, and the leakage decreases when the input size increases. We finally show that he single prediction protocol is quite ecient but the Top-n is not. However, we observe that the eciency of the Top-n protocol can be dramatically improved if we slightly relax the desired security guarantee.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Users visit on-line services and compose them to accomplish on-line tasks. Quite often, users enter the same information into various web forms to finish on-line tasks. However, repetitively typing the same information into web forms is a tedious job. In this paper, we propose a context-aware ranking framework to rank values for input parameters. We propose 6 categories of ranking features constructed from various types of information, such as user contexts and usage patterns. Our framework adopts learning-to-rank (LtR) algorithms, machine learned models, to automatically construct ranking models by integrating ranking features. When a user enters a value to an input parameter, an interaction between the user input and the input parameter is established. Our framework learns information relevant to such interactions and ranks user inputs under different contexts. Through empirical studies on real-world on-line services, we obtain the following main results: (1) Among 8 state-of-the-art LtR models, RankBoost outperforms other LtR models on ranking user inputs for input parameters; (2) Our framework using IRSVM that performs the worst among LtR models outperforms two baseline ranking models and Chrome Auto-filling on ranking user inputs; and (3) Textual information, user time and location matter the most to the input ranking.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Concurrent programs are difficult to test due to their inherent non-determinism. To address this problem, testing often requires the exploration of thread schedules of a program; this can be time-consuming when applied to real-world programs. Software defect prediction has been used to help developers find faults and prioritize their testing efforts. Prior studies have used machine learning to build such predicting models based on designed features that encode the characteristics of programs. However, research has focused on sequential programs; to date, no work has considered defect prediction for concurrent programs, with program characteristics distinguished from sequential programs. In this paper, we present ConPredictor, an approach to predict defects specific to concurrent programs by combining both static and dynamic program metrics. Specifically, we propose a set of novel static code metrics based on the unique properties of concurrent programs. We also leverage additional guidance from dynamic metrics constructed based on mutation analysis. Our evaluation on four large open source projects shows that ConPredictor improved both within-project defect prediction and cross-project defect prediction compared to traditional features.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the popularization of mobile phone usage, telecommunication networks have turned into a socially binding medium. Considering the traces of human communication held inside these networks, telecommunication networks are now able to provide a proxy for human social networks. To study degree characteristics and structural properties in large-scale social networks, we gathered a tera-scale dataset of call detail records that contains 5 107 nodes and 3:6 1010 links for three GSM (mobile) networks, as well as 1:4 107 nodes and 1:9 109 links for one PSTN (fixed-line) network. In this paper, we first empirically evaluate some statistical models against the degree distribution of the country&amp;#x2019;s call graph and determine that a Pareto lognormal distribution provides the best fit, despite claims in the literature that power-law distribution is the best model. We then question how network operator, size, density, and location affect degree distribution to understand the parameters governing it in social networks. Our empirical analysis indicates that changes in density, operator and location do not show a particular correlation with degree distribution; however, the average degree of social networks is proportional to the logarithm of network size. We also report on the structural properties of the communication network. These novel results are useful for managing and planning communication networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Localization using the time-of-arrival (ToA) of a wideband signal has the potential to achieve high accuracy, thereby making it a promising choice for a variety of applications. However, a major challenge impacting localization accuracy is multipath propagation, i.e., the existence of indirect paths from a target to an anchor (transceiver) via one or more abstacles present in the environment. In this paper, we provide an overview of the techniques proposed in the literature to analyze and address the effects of multipath on localization accuracy. For this purpose, we first cast the localization of one or more targets as a maximum a priori estimation problem, where the distribution of the amplitudes and ToAs of the indirect paths serves as a prior. Under this framework, we show that multipath can either be a blessing or a curse depending on the extent of prior knowledge available about the multipath statistics. Specifically, in the absence of any indirect path information, only the direct paths that go straight from a target to an anchor contain useful position information; in other words, multipath negatively impacts localization performance. Thus, in this case, it is important to detect the anchors having line-of-sight to the target(s), and we review the techniques reported in the literature to solve this problem. On the other hand, if complete indirect path information is available (i.e., the propagation paths of all the multipath components are known), then each indirect path is equivalent to a direct path from a virtual anchor, and hence, the spatial diversity offered by multipath can be exploited for improving localization accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the deployment of monitoring devices, the smart grid is collecting large amounts of energy-related data at an unprecedented speed. The smart grid has become data-driven, which necessitates extracting meaningful data from a large dataset. The traditional approach of data extraction improves the computing efficiency in temporal dimension, but it is made for only one task in the smart grid. Moreover, the existing solutions neglect the geographical distribution of computing capacity in a large-scale smart grid. The future large-scale smart grid will run over the internet of energy where the dataset will be sent to a specific destination along power routers hop-by-hop. Consequently, we design a novel temporal, functional and spatial big data computing framework for large-scale smart grid. In functional dimension, we divide every dataset into sub-groups, each of which has data items shared by different tasks. In spatial dimension, we determine which location the power router should be placed to harvest computing resources used for extracting the sub-group of data items. Our method achieves a promising computing efficiency approaching to the optimal solution with 95% convergence ratio, and it saves the in-path bandwidth with 81% improvement ratio over benchmarks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Visual features have been widely used for image representation and categorization. However, visual features are often inconsistent with human perception. Besides, constructing explicit semantic space is still an open problem. To alleviate these two problems, in this paper, we propose to construct structured weak semantic space for image representation. Exemplar classifier is first trained to separate each training image from other images for weak semantic space construction. However, each exemplar classifier separates one training image from other images, and it only has limited semantic separability. Besides, the outputs of exemplar classifiers are inconsistent with each other. We jointly construct the weak semantic space using structured constraint. This is achieved by imposing low-rank constraint on the outputs of exemplar classifiers with sparsity constraint. An alternative optimization procedure is used to learn the exemplar classifiers. Since the proposed method does not dependent on the initial image representation strategy, we can make use of various visual features for efficient exemplar classifier training (e.g., fisher vector-based methods and convolutional neural networks-based methods). We apply the proposed structured weak semantic space-based image representation method for categorization. The experimental results on several public image data sets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Previous works on collective inference mainly focus on exploiting the autocorrelation among instances in a static network during the inference process. There are also approaches on time series prediction, which mainly exploit the autocorrelation within an instance at different time points. However, the response variables of related instances can co-evolve over time and their evolutions are not following a static correlation across time, but are following an internal life cycle. In this paper, we study the collective evolution inference problem, where the goal is to predict the response variables values for a group of related instances at the end of their life cycles. This problem is highly challenging because different instances can co-evolve over time and they can be at different stages of their life cycles and thus have different evolving patterns. Moreover, instances usually connected through heterogeneous networks, which involve complex relationships among instances. We propose an approach, called NetCycle+, by incorporating information from related instances and their life cycles. Furthermore, for studying the deep dependencies between nodes, we extend the graph convolution into NetCycle+. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can improve the inference performance by considering the autocorrelation through networks and the life cycles of the instances.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Identifying kinship relations has garnered interest due to several applications such as organizing and tagging the enormous amount of videos being uploaded on the Internet. Existing research in kinship verification primarily focuses on kinship prediction with image pairs. In this research, we propose a new deep learning framework for kinship verification in unconstrained videos using a novel Supervised Mixed Norm regularization Autoencoder (SMNAE). This new autoencoder formulation introduces class-specific sparsity in the weight matrix. The proposed three-stage SMNAE based kinship verification framework utilizes the learned spatio-temporal representation in the video frames for verifying kinship in a pair of videos. A new kinship video (KIVI) database of more than 500 individuals with variations due to illumination, pose, occlusion, ethnicity, and expression is collected for this research. It comprises a total of 355 true kin video pairs with over 250,000 still frames. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the KIVI database and six existing kinship databases. On the KIVI database, SMNAE yields video-based kinship verification accuracy of 83.18&amp;#x0025; which is at least 3.2&amp;#x0025; better than existing algorithms. The algorithm is also evaluated on six publicly available kinship databases and compared with best reported results. It is observed that the proposed SMNAE consistently yields best results on all the databases.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A key aspect of a sustainable urban transportation system is the effectiveness of transportation policies. To be effective, a policy has to consider a broad range of elements, such as pollution emission, traffic flow, and human mobility. Due to the complexity and variability of these elements in the urban area, to produce effective policies remains a very challenging task. With the introduction of the smart city paradigm, a widely available amount of data can be generated in urban spaces. Such data can be a fundamental source of knowledge to improve policies because they can reflect the sustainability issues underlying the city. In this context, we propose an approach to exploit urban positioning data based on stigmergy, a bio-inspired mechanism providing scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. By employing stigmergy, samples in proximity with each other are aggregated into a functional structure called trail. The trail summarizes relevant dynamics in data and allows matching them, providing a measure of their similarity. Moreover, this mechanism can be specialized to unfold specific dynamics. Specifically, we identify high-density urban areas (i.e. hotspots), analyze their activity over time, and unfold anomalies. Furthermore, by matching activity patterns, a continuous measure of the dissimilarity with respect to the typical activity pattern is provided. This measure can be used by policy makers to evaluate the effect of policies and change them dynamically. As a case study, we analyze taxi trip data gathered in Manhattan from 2013 to 2015.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>On most online social media sites today, user-generated data remains accessible to allowed viewers unless the data owner controls its exposure explicitly. This article presents a large-scale measurement study in a popular social media site, Twitter, focused on understanding how users control the longitudinal exposure of their publicly shared social data (i.e., tweets) and the limitations of the currently employed control mechanisms. Our study finds that although longitudinal exposure control mechanisms are widely employed by Twitter users, they have two fundamental problems. Firstly even when a user deletes her data or account, the current mechanisms leave significant traces of residual activity; e.g., in Twitter, tweets from other users sent as replies to deleted tweets or accounts still remain accessible. Secondly, these mechanisms single out withdrawn tweets or accounts and attract undesirable attention to those. Towards overcoming these problems, we explore an inactivity-based withdrawal scheme for improved longitudinal exposure control.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With mobile devices (e.g. Android and iOS devices) and other resource constrained Internet-connected devices (e.g. sensors) becoming the norm in our digitalized society, the capacity to ensure security of data-in-transit and at-rest without incurring unrealistic performance overheads is crucial. Rather than using conventional encryption, in this paper we propose the Dynamic Privacy Protection (DPP) model. The model is designed for ensuring mobile device user privacy even in large volume of data transmissions, which uses dynamic programming to produce an optimal solution of maximizing privacy protection levels even for resource constrained devices. We then develop an Android app and use it to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. The findings suggest that the proposed model allows us to achieve improved privacy protection.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Virtual rehabilitation environments may afford greater patient personalization if they could harness the patient&amp;#x0027;s affective state. Four states: anxiety, pain, engagement and tiredness (either physical or psychological), were hypothesized to be inferable from observable metrics of hand location and gripping strength -relevant for rehabilitation-. Contributions are; (a) multiresolution classifier built from Semi-Na&amp;#x00EF;ve Bayesian classifiers, and (b) establishing predictive relations for the considered states from the motor proxies capitalizing on the proposed classifier with recognition levels sufficient for exploitation. 3D hand locations and gripping strength streams were recorded from 5 post-stroke patients whilst undergoing motor rehabilitation therapy administered through virtual rehabilitation along 10 sessions over 4 weeks. Features from the streams characterized the motor dynamics, while spontaneous manifestations of the states were labelled from concomitant videos by experts for supervised classification. The new classifier was compared against baseline support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) with all three exhibiting comparable performances. Inference of the aforementioned states departing from chosen motor surrogates appears feasible, expediting increased personalization of virtual motor neurorehabilitation therapies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In our present society, the cinema has become one of the major forms of entertainment providing unlimited contexts of emotion elicitation for the emotional needs of human beings. Since emotions are universal and shape all aspects of our interpersonal and intellectual experience, they have proved to be a highly multidisciplinary research field, ranging from psychology, sociology, neuroscience, etc., to computer science. However, affective multimedia content analysis work from the computer science community benefits but little from the progress achieved in other research fields. In this paper, a multidisciplinary state-of-the-art for affective movie content analysis is given, in order to promote and encourage exchanges between researchers from a very wide range of fields. In contrast to other state-of-the-art papers on affective video content analysis, this work confronts the ideas and models of psychology, sociology, neuroscience, and computer science. The concepts of aesthetic emotions and emotion induction, as well as the different representations of emotions are introduced, based on psychological and sociological theories. Previous global and continuous affective video content analysis work, including video emotion recognition and violence detection, are also presented in order to point out the limitations of affective video content analysis work.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Interpersonal human-human interaction is a dynamical exchange and coordination of social signals, feelings and emotions usually performed through and across multiple modalities such as facial expressions, gestures, and language. Developing machines able to engage humans in rich and natural interpersonal interactions requires capturing such dynamics. This paper addresses primitive emotional contagion during dyadic interactions in which roles are prefixed. Primitive emotional contagion was defined as the tendency people have to automatically mimic and synchronize their multimodal behavior during interactions and, consequently, to emotionally converge. To capture emotional contagion, a cross-recurrence based methodology that explicitly integrates short and long-term temporal dynamics through the analysis of both facial expressions and sentiment was developed. This approach is employed to assess emotional contagion at unimodal, multimodal and cross-modal levels and is evaluated on the Solid SAL-SEMAINE corpus. Interestingly, the approach is able to show the importance of the adoption of cross-modal strategies for addressing emotional contagion.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Research on influence maximization has often to cope with marketing needs relating to the propagation of information towards specific users. However, little attention has been paid to the fact that the success of an information diffusion campaign might depend not only on the number of the initial influencers to be detected but also on their diversity w.r.t. the target of the campaign. Our main hypothesis is that if we learn seeds that are not only capable of influencing but also are linked to more diverse (groups of) users, then the influence triggers will be diversified as well, and hence the target users will get higher chance of being engaged. Upon this intuition, we define a novel problem, named Diversity-sensitive Targeted Influence Maximization (DTIM), which assumes to model user diversity by exploiting only topological information within a social graph. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to bring the concept of topology-driven diversity into targeted IM problems, for which we define two alternative definitions. Accordingly, we propose approximate solutions of DTIM, which detect a size-k set of users that maximizes the diversity-sensitive capital objective function, for a given selection of target users. We evaluate our DTIM methods on a special case of user engagement in online social networks, which concerns users who are not actively involved in the community life. Experimental evaluation on real networks has demonstrated the meaningfulness of our approach, also highlighting the usefulness of further development of solutions for DTIM applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Previous political sciences research has revealed that democracy (democratic institutions, consultations with citizens) and technocracy (specialized knowledge of experts) are the main foundations for the development of effective and socially acceptable public policies, and that there should be balance as well as interaction and exchange of knowledge between them. However, there is a lack of e-participation platforms supporting the collection of policy related information, knowledge and opinions from both citizens and experts, as well as the communication and interaction between them. This paper contributes to filling this critical research gap. It describes the development of an innovative e-participation platform, which supports on one hand structured consultation and argumentation between experts/technocrats concerning important social problems and public policies for addressing them, and on the other hand the collection and interrelation of relevant citizens-generated policy related textual content from numerous external social media. This platform enables the meaningful combination of technocrats&amp;#x0027; expertise with public opinion, allowing the technocrats participating in policy related structured consultations to access, understand and take into account citizens&amp;#x0027; perceptions. Evaluation results show that users appreciated the potential of exploiting the synergy of machine and human reasoning enabled by the proposed platform through a combination of data mining and collaborative decision making services.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Internet-of-Things (IoT) has already connected billions of devices to the Internet. These devices are collecting zettabytes (&lt;formula&gt; &lt;tex&gt;$10^{21}$&lt;/tex&gt; &lt;/formula&gt;) of data. However, the current IoT framework suffers from limited sensor energy, communication bandwidth, and server storage. These limitations impede the ability to send all the sensor data to the server all the time. Compact smart sensors provide a way to address this challenge. As opposed to the conventional sense-and-transmit sensors, emerging smart sensors can collect data, extract features, derive local inferences, and transmit only inference outcomes and possibly some raw data associated with rare events, instead of all the raw data. This can dramatically cut down on the amount of sensor data transmitted, and hence its communication energy and network traffic. However, edge or server inference models trained with conventional machine learning approaches do not account for the fact that the smart sensors in the system have already performed a local inference. These approaches need all the sensor data and hence only cater to the traditional sense-and-transmit paradigm. This undoes the energy benefits brought about by smart sensors. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical inference model for IoT applications based on hierarchical learning and local inferences. Our model is able to take advantage of inference already performed on smart sensors, while at the same time accommodating conventional sense-and-transmit sensors in the IoT system. It also generalizes sensor-level inference to inference at other edge nodes by exploiting the intrinsically sensor/edge-grouped IoT data structure. We train classifiers hierarchically, aligned with the sensor-edge-server IoT paradigm. We verify our approach with seven IoT applications, demonstrating that the model is accurate, efficient, and generally applicable. We derive four edge-level inference models and four server-level inference models for these applicati- ns. For the four edge-level inference models, we reduce the number of bits transmitted from the sensor by &lt;formula&gt; &lt;tex&gt;$3.2 times-42.7 times$&lt;/tex&gt; &lt;/formula&gt; while at the same time also improving the classification accuracy by &lt;formula&gt; &lt;tex&gt;$0:3%-6:7%$&lt;/tex&gt; &lt;/formula&gt;. For the four server-level inference models, we reduce the number of edge-to-server bits transmitted by &lt;formula&gt; &lt;tex&gt;$17 times-60 times$&lt;/tex&gt; &lt;/formula&gt;, with classification accuracy change in the &lt;formula&gt; &lt;tex&gt;$-0.4%-+0.1%$&lt;/tex&gt; &lt;/formula&gt; range.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We present a quasiexperiment to investigate whether, and to what extent, sleep deprivation impacts performance of novice developers using the agile practice of test-first development (TFD). We recruited 45 undergraduates, and asked them to tackle a programming task. Among participants, 23 agreed to stay awake the night before carrying out the task, while 22 slept normally. We analyzed the quality of the implementations delivered by the participants in both groups, their engagement in writing source code and ability to apply TFD. By comparing the two groups of participants, we found that a single night of sleep deprivation leads to a reduction of 50% in the quality of the implementations. There is notable evidence that the developers&amp;#x0027; engagement and their prowess to apply TFD arenegatively impacted. Our results also show that sleep-deprived developers make more fixes to syntactic mistakes in the sourcecode. We conclude that sleep deprivation has possibly disruptive effects on development activities. Results open opportunities for improving developers&amp;#x0027; performance by integrating the study of sleep with other psycho-physiological factors in which the software engineering research community has recently taken an interest in.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Correspondence problems are challenging due to the complexity of real-world scenes. One way to solve this problem is to improve the graph matching (GM) process, which is flexible for matching non-rigid objects. GM can be classified into three categories that correspond with the variety of object functions: first-order, second-order and, high-order matching. Graph and hypergraph matching have been proposed separately in previous works. The former is equivalent to second-order GM, and the latter is equivalent to high-order GM, but we use the terms second- and high-order GM to unify the terminology in this paper. Second- and high-order GM fit well with different types of problems; the key goal for these processes is to find better-optimized algorithms. Because the optimal problems for second- and high-order GM are different, we propose two novel optimized algorithms for them in this paper. (1) For second-order GM, we first introduce a K-Nearest-Neighbor-Pooling Matching (KNNPM) method that integrates feature pooling into GM and reduces the complexity. Meanwhile, we evaluate each matching candidate using discriminative weights on its k-nearest neighbors (KNN) by taking locality as well as sparsity into consideration. (2) High-order GM introduces numerous outliers because precision is rarely considered in related methods. Therefore, we propose a sub-pattern structure to construct a robust high-order GM method that better integrates geometric information. To narrow the search space and solve the optimization problem, a new prior strategy and a cell-algorithm-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework are proposed, respectively. In addition, experiments demonstrate the robustness and improvements of these algorithms with respect to matching accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With more awareness and growth in the cloud market, demands for computational resources have increased in order to provide services to the cloud users. Sometimes it is difficult for an individual cloud service provider (CSP) to meet the level of promised quality of service (QoS) and to fulfill all types of resource requests dynamically. Cloud federation has become a consolidated paradigm in which group of cooperative CSPs share their unused resources with peers to gain some economic benefit. Hence, the cloud federation overcomes the limitation of each CSP for maintaining QoS during sudden spikes in resource demand. However, the presence of untrusted CSPs degrades the QoS of the services delivered through federation. Trusted CSPs are highly reputed in the federation as they can extend their resources and services to maintain the level of committed QoS by the member CSPs of the federation. Therefore, to guarantee delivery of committed QoS, it will be necessary to form a federation with trusted CSPs only. In this paper, we present a broker based cloud federation architecture. The cloud federation formation is modeled as a hedonic coalitional game. The main objective of this work is to find the most suitable and stable federation of trusted CSPs that will maximize the satisfaction level of each individual CSP on the basis of QoS and profit. The proposed coalitional game inspired cloud federation formation (CGCFF) algorithm has been extensively compared with selected existing techniques. Simulation results show that the set of federation formed by CGCFF is Nash-stable and performs better than these techniques in terms of satisfaction, quality and profit.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Most of current Data Center Network (DCN) protocols leverage Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) for congestion control to maintain low latency and high throughput. However, the majority of them only consider single-queue scenario in each switch port, making their performance inferior in multiple-service multiple-queue scenario. To this end, we propose DemePro, a DCN scheme for multiple-service multiple-queue scenario. In face of congestion signal, DemePro also leverages ECN for congestion notification, while decouples packet marking from enqueuing, in order to ensure fairness among multiple services. We also question the effectiveness of the congestion signal derived from the single threshold for port buffer queue length, via a set of experiments. Then, DemePro utilizes multiple thresholds for proactive congestion control, and packets are encapsulated to carry congestion extent information, in order to notify TCP senders for precise and fine-grained congestion control. Experiments show that DemePro has better performance than MQ-ECN [1] which is currently the best DCN scheme for multiple-service multiple-queue scenario, and DemePro can also well guarantee the fairness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Multifeature learning has been a fundamental research problem in multimedia analysis. Most existing multifeature learning methods exploit graph, which must be computed beforehand, as input to uncover data distribution. These methods have two major problems confronted. First, graph construction requires calculating similarity based on nearby data pairs by a fixed function, e.g., the RBF kernel, but the intrinsic correlation among different data pairs varies constantly. Therefore, feature learning based on such predefined graphs may degrade, especially when there is dramatic correlation variation between nearby data pairs. Second, in most existing algorithms, each single-feature graph is computed independently and then combine them for learning, which ignores the correlation between multiple features. In this paper, a new unsupervised multifeature learning method is proposed to make the best utilization of the correlation among different features by jointly optimizing data correlation from multiple features in an adaptive way. As opposed to computing the affinity weight of data pairs by a fixed function, the weight of affinity graph is learned by a well-designed optimization problem. Additionally, the affinity graph of data pairs from different features is optimized in a global level to better leverage the correlation among different channels. In this way, the adaptive approach correlates the features of all features for a better learning process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on leveraging multiple features for multimedia analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Device-to-device (D2D) communication is continuously evolving and engulfing a wide diversity of proximate services and applications, which is considered as one of the key technologies in the 5G ecosystem. It is argued that direct communications paradigm advantages may not be entirely captured without embracing the concepts of the social-domain. Following the explosion of social networks and smart mobile devices, social-interactions among mobile users enable the promotion of D2D co-operations. In this article, we first present a systematic overview of the socially-unaware technical challenges and the prospective applications to consolidate a background on D2D communications. Next, all the social features utilized in tackling and improving the technical issues and the applications are briefed, respectively. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on socially-aware D2D communications, where various features of social-domain are leveraged such as ties, community, trust, and selfishness to tackle the D2D technical issues and improve the performance of prospective D2D applications. We categorize state-of-the-art socially-aware D2D communications into two main sections. The first section considers technical issues, while the second section pertains to their applications to provide insightful information and motivate more in-depth studies in this area. For each aforementioned section, we overview technical aspects and classify the core contributions based on approaches used and the social features utilized. In the discussion section, we summarize the socially-aware D2D communications and present lessons learned. Finally, we highlight the open research challenges in this field and predict future research trends.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, a fuzzy agglomerative (FuzAg) approach is proposed for community detection that iteratively updates membership degree of nodes. Earlier approaches assign membership degree to nodes based on communities only. We introduce the notion of self-membership in addition to the membership of different communities. The essence of self-membership is to give opportunity to all nodes in growing their own community. Nodes having higher self-membership degree are referred as anchors, and they get a chance to expand their associated community. Meanwhile, some new anchors may emerge in successive iterations while false or redundant anchors get removed. The time complexity of proposed algorithm is shown to be O(n&lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$^{2}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;). We compare the results of the proposed FuzAg algorithm with those of state-of-the-art fuzzy community detection algorithms on ten real-world datasets as well as on synthetic networks. Results indicated by various quality and accuracy metrics show impressive performance of FuzAg in identifying both disjoint communities and fuzzy communities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Non-life threatening chronic health conditions can significantly reduce the quality of life for the patient and their family. Given pressure on specialist services and lengthy wait-times, we propose a novel approach that involves a website and virtual specialist for patients while they are awaiting their specialist appointment. To capture patient history and provide tailored treatment advice an interactive website was developed. To increase adherence the website was enhanced with an empathic embodied conversational agent to allow discussion of the suggested treatment. A six-month trial with 74 children with urinary incontinence showed an overall improvement in 74% of patients, with 38% those who used the program reporting a resolution of their wetting without needing a specialist appointment. Capturing the expertise of medical specialists to provide online tailored treatment advice and use of humanlike face-to-face conversations to educate and build rapport with the patient appeared to increase treatment adherence compared to an earlier text-based version without the empathic agent.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A variety of contemporary technologies are being framed within the Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, including publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems. In IoT, things, such as objects, machines, vehicles, and wireless sensors, have to communicate with other things or humans and exchange information based on Internet connectivity. With the integration of pub/sub mechanism with IoT, these things can &amp;#x201C;publish&amp;#x201D; their presence to a specific node, which can be named a broker or router, while things that &amp;#x201C;subscribe&amp;#x201D; to that node are able to receive information based on publishers&amp;#x2019; content. In order to perceive a sound and efficient pub/sub structure in IoT, high performance processing and interoperability are valid requirements. This paper presents a versatile architecture of a broker, named X2CBBR, that can operate in IoT with different pub/sub systems. X2CBBR (1) adopts XML-based publication data and XPath-based subscription data to yield interoperability; (2) processes both XML data and XPath queries in hardware (instead of software) to boost processing performance; (3) employs a hardware-based matching mechanism that exploits subscription commonalities; and (4) makes use of four different operation modes as a method for accepting or limiting acceptance of either publications or subscriptions. While maintaining the total decoupling feature between publishers and subscribers, the broker switches from an operation mode to another to keep traffic under control. Moreover, its content-based routing mechanism avoids redundant subscription and notification data. Finally, the broker can effectively operate in either centralized or distributed systems. The results obtained through a prototype hardware implementation targeting an FPGA demonstrate the high-efficiency of the broker/router in multiple scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A honeypot is a type of security facility deliberately created to be probed, attacked, and compromised. It is often used for protecting production systems by detecting and deflecting unauthorized accesses. It is also useful for investigating the behavior of attackers, and in particular, unknown attacks. For the past 17 years plenty of effort has been invested in the research and development of honeypot techniques, and they have evolved to be an increasingly powerful means of defending against the creations of the blackhat community. In this paper, by studying a wide set of honeypots, the two essential elements of honeypots&amp;#x2014;the decoy and the captor&amp;#x2014;are captured and presented, together with two abstract organizational forms&amp;#x2014;independent and cooperative&amp;#x2014;where these two elements can be integrated. A novel decoy and captor (D-C) based taxonomy is proposed for the purpose of studying and classifying the various honeypot techniques. An extensive set of independent and cooperative honeypot projects and research that cover these techniques is surveyed under the taxonomy framework. Furthermore, two subsets of features from the taxonomy are identified, which can greatly influence the honeypot performances. These two subsets of features are applied to a number of typical independent and cooperative honeypots separately in order to validate the taxonomy and predict the honeypot development trends.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the head pose and body orientation of a person from a low-resolution image. Under this setting, it is difficult to reliably extract facial features or detect body parts. We propose a convolutional random projection forest (CRPforest) algorithm for these tasks. A convolutional random projection network (CRPnet) is used at each node of the forest. It maps an input image to a high-dimensional feature space using a rich filter bank. The filter bank is designed to generate sparse responses so that they can be efficiently computed by compressive sensing. A sparse random projection matrix can capture most essential information contained in the filter bank without using all the filters in it. Therefore, the CRPnet is fast, e.g., it requires &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$0.04ms$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; to process an image of &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$50 times 50$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; pixels, due to the small number of convolutions (e.g., 0.01% of a layer of a neural network) at the expense of less than 2% accuracy. The overall forest estimates head and body pose well on benchmark datasets, e.g., over 98% on the HIIT dataset, while requiring at &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$3.8ms$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; without using a GPU. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in low-resolution images.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The increasing volume of climate data pose the need for scientists to develop scalable data analysis tools beyond the traditional techniques. Climate data not only comes in massive scale, but is also of high dimension and complex dependency structures, which makes the analysis task extremely challenging. Climate informatics leverages the advanced algorithmic tools from data science to solve problems in climate science. This paper showcases how scalable multivariate time series models can be developed for climate change attribution, spatio-temporal analysis, and extreme value time series analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, app developers tend to integrate advertisement libraries (or ad libraries) into their apps to get revenue from ad networks. However, researches have shown that both ad libraries and ad contents could raise serious security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose AdCapsule, a user-level solution to practically confine advertisements, including ad libraries and ad contents. Our solution does not need to change the Android framework, nor requires the root privilege, thus can be readily deployed. Specifically, we propose the permission sandbox, which isolates the permissions used by ad libraries from the host app, and the file sandbox, which separates the file operations of advertisements. The ad library and ad content cannot read or write any file outside this sandbox. We have implemented a prototype of AdCapsule. Our evaluation results indicate that AdCapsule can successfully enforce security policies to block attempts of accessing private information or manipulating files of the host app, and the performance overhead introduced by AdCapsule is low.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>MapReduce is a widely-used programming model in cloud environment for parallel processing large-scale data sets. The combination of the high-level language with a SQL-to-MapReduce translator allows programmers to code using SQL-like declarative language, so that each program can afterwards be complied into a MapReduce jobflow automatically. This way is helpful to narrow the gap between non-professional users and cloud platforms, and thus significantly improve the usability of the cloud. Although a number of translators have been developed, the auto-generated MapReduce programs still suffered from extremely inefficiency. In this paper, we present an efficient Cost-Aware SQL-to-MapReduce Translator (CAT). CAT has two notable features. First, it defines two intra-SQL correlations: Generalized Job Flow Correlation (GJFC) and Input Correlation (IC), based on which a set of looser merging rules are introduced. Thus, both Top-Down (TD) and Bottom-Up (BU) merging strategies are proposed and integrated into CAT simultaneously. Second, it adopts a cost estimation model for MapReduce jobflows to guide the selection of a more efficient MapReduce jobflows auto-generated by TD and BU merging strategies. Finally, comparative experiments on TPC-H benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of CAT.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Website visitors are performing increasingly complex computational work on the websites&amp;#x0027; behalf, such as validating forms, rendering animations, and producing data visualizations. In this paper, we explore the possibility of increasing the work offloaded to web visitors&amp;#x0027; browsers. The idle computing cycles of web visitors can be turned into a large-scale distributed data processing engine, which we term gray computing. Past research has looked primarily at either volunteer computing with specialized clients or browser-based volunteer computing where the visitors keep their browsers open to a single web page for a long period of time. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the architecture, performance, security, cost effectiveness, user experience, and other issues of gray computing distributed data processing engines with heterogeneous computing power, non-uniform page view times, and high computing pool volatility. Several real-world applications are examined and gray computing is shown to be cost effective for a number of complex tasks ranging from computer vision to bioinformatics to cryptology.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Object proposal algorithms have been demonstrated to be very successful in accelerating object detection process. High object localization quality and detection recall can be obtained using thousands of proposals. However, the performance with a small number of proposals is still unsatisfactory. This paper demonstrates that the performance of a few proposals can be significantly improved with the minimal human interaction - a single touch point. To this end, we first generate hierarchical superpixels using an efficient tree-organized structure as our initial object proposals, and then select only a few proposals from them by learning an effective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for objectness ranking. We explore and design an architecture to integrate human interaction with the global information of the whole image for objectness scoring, which is able to significantly improve the performance with a minimum number of object proposals. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods for locating the meaningful object with the touch point constraint. Furthermore, the proposed method is extended for video. By combining with the novel interactive motion segmentation cue for generating hierarchical superpixels, the performance on a single proposal is satisfactory and can be used in the interactive vision systems such as selecting the input of a real-time tracking system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Because the bufferbloat phenomenon has significantly degraded the quality of service of interactive applications, there is pressing need for effective active queue management (AQM) strategies to be deployed at both intermediate devices and consumer edges. Existing models and AQM design methods usually lack sufficient consideration of heterogenous round-trip times, uncertain endpoint mechanisms and time-varying network conditions. This paper proposes an innovative information compression model purely from routers&amp;#x2019; perspective by evaluating the average effect an accepted/dropped packet has on the aggregated packet arriving rate. The proposed model is independent of round-trip time heterogeneity and specific endpoint protocols. A customized parameter identification algorithm and corresponding control strategy are developed to scale the regulating sensitivity of dropping probability adaptively. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvements of the proposed algorithm in providing a good trade-off between reducing the latency and maximizing the goodput, especially in large delay environments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Offloading of tasks to the cloud is one of the approaches to improve the performance of distributed applications. When monetary constraints are present, selection of the tasks to be offloaded becomes important in order to ensure efficient use of the available cloud resources. This becomes a challenge for large scale distributed applications as the decisions on offloading have to be made locally at the nodes without an exact global view of the system. In our earlier work, we modeled this challenge as a new class of formal problems termed cloudy knapsack problem and derived some theoretical bounds on the solution space for worst case task sequences. In many real world applications, the task sequences have inherent patterns which can be exploited to improve offloading. In this work, we propose a cloud offloading algorithm that exploits these patterns through offline and online learning. Experimental evaluation using realistic datasets for a cloud-assisted peer-to-peer search case study reveals that the proposed solution performs close to a hypothetical omniscient offloading algorithm having a complete view of the system. The proposed cloud-assisted peer-to-peer search engine provides a cost-effective approach to address scalability bottleneck in peer-to-peer search engines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The application of Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) in health sector is crucial. It prolongs the life expectancy and improves the quality of life by enabling remote health monitoring. Despite many advantages, it may result and exacerbates various extant health issues especially in the context of mobile multimedia. Due to high data rate of mobile multimedia applications, heat generated from sensor devices is considerably high and results in thermal dissipation. The thermal impact of sensors on human body has largely been a neglected topic. The paper rigorously analyzes the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) impact on human body. Moreover, the paper largely contributes by comprehensively evaluating SAR impact under various circumstances and dependency factors. The analysis and evaluation show promising results that can significantly help the successful design and deployment of WBAN strategies. The paper also provides great guidance to numerous practitioners of this domain.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The latent friend recommendation in online social media is interesting, yet challenging, because the user-item ratings and the user-user relationships are both sparse. In this paper, we propose a new dual implicit mining-based latent friend recommendation model that simultaneously considers the implicit interest topics of users and the implicit link relationships between the users in the local topic cliques. Specifically, we first propose an algorithm called all reviews from a user and all tags from their corresponding items to learn the implicit interest topics of the users and their corresponding topic weights, then compute the user interest topic similarity using a symmetric Jensen-Shannon divergence. After that, we adopt the proposed weighted local random walk with restart algorithm to analyze the implicit link relationships between the users in the local topic cliques and calculate the weighted link relationship similarity between the users. Combining the user interest topic similarity with the weighted link relationship similarity in a unified way, we get the final latent friend recommendation list. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art latent friend recommendation methods under four different types of evaluation metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Today&amp;#x0027;s advanced media technology preaches an enthralling time that will enormously bear on daily life. Moreover the rapid raise of wireless communications and networking will ultimately bring advanced media to our lives anytime, anywhere, and on any device. According to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cloud Computing (CC) is a scheme for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing pores (for example networks, applications, storage, servers and services) which could be promptly foresighted and delivered with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This paper proposed an efficient algorithm for advanced scalable Media-based Smart Big Data (3D, Ultra HD) on Intelligent Cloud Computing systems.The proposed encoding algorithm outperforms the conventional HEVC standard which demonstrated by the performance evaluations. In order to ratify the proposed approach in addition, a relative study has been carried out. The proposed method could be used and integrated into HEVC, as a Smart Big Data, without violating the standard.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Uncertain graphs are prevalent in several applications including communications systems, biological databases and social networks. The ever increasing size of the underlying data renders both graph storage and query processing extremely expensive. Sparsification has often been used to reduce the size of deterministic graphs by maintaining only the important edges. However, adaptation of deterministic sparsification methods fails in the uncertain setting. To overcome this problem, we introduce the first sparsification techniques aimed explicitly at uncertain graphs. The proposed methods reduce the number of edges and redistribute their probabilities in order to decrease the graph size, while preserving its underlying structure. The resulting graph can be used to efficiently and accurately approximate any query and mining tasks on the original graph. An extensive experimental evaluation with real and synthetic datasets illustrates the effectiveness of our techniques on several common graph tasks, including clustering coefficient, page rank, reliability and shortest path distance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the rapid advances of information technologies, Big Data, recognized with 4Vs characteristics (volume, variety, veracity, and velocity), bring significant benefits as well as many challenges. A major benefit of Big Data is to provide timely information and proactive services for humans. The primary purpose of this paper is to review the current state-of-the-art of Big Data from the aspects of organization and representation, cleaning and reduction, integration and processing, security and privacy, analytics and applications, then present a novel framework to provide high-quality so called Big Data-as-a-services. The framework consists of three planes, namely sensing plane, cloud plane and application plane, to systemically address all the challenges of the above aspects. Also, to clearly demonstrate the working process of the proposed framework, a tensor-based multiple clustering on bicycle renting and returning data is illustrated, which can provide several suggestions for the bicycle rebalancing of bicycle-sharing system. Meanwhile, some challenges about the proposed framework are discussed as well.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The European Union (EU)'s keen concern about citizens' health and well-being protection and advancement has been expressed at all levels. It has been understood that at present, it can only be achieved through coordinated actions at the individual member states' level based on EU directives, as well as through promoting and funding quadruple helix R&amp;D and expanding the use of eHealth technologies. Despite the diversities and particularities among member states, common values such as universal access to good quality healthcare, equity and solidarity have been widely accepted across EU. That demanded the adoption of policies and follow directives, which streamlined actions to bridge healthcare gaps, and facilitate cross-border healthcare. This paper articulates a framework for deriving a national healthcare system, based on interoperable Electronic Health Record (EHR) with safeguarding healthcare quality, enabling quadruple helix driven R&amp;D and guided by a patient-centered approach. A methodology to develop an integrated EHR at National level is proposed as a prerequisite for eHealth and put into perspective. Recommendations are given for the steps needed, from the managerial, legal, technical and financial concerns in developing an open access, patient-centered national healthcare system based on the context and constraints of a country. The example of a small country to apply the proposed methodology is demonstrated. Stakeholders, including citizens, healthcare professionals, academia and the industry are mobilized, enabled, and incentivized for implementing the methodology. Experiences are aspired to be offered as lessons learned for other countries to adapt on their environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this study, a new two-stage learning based reduction approach for Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) is introduced in order to reduce the number of concepts. FCM is a graphical modeling technique that follows a reasoning approach similar to the human reasoning and decision-making process. The FCM model incorporates the available knowledge and expertise in the form of concepts and in the direction and strength of the interactions among concepts. One of the modeling problems of FCMs is that over-sized FCM models suffer from interpretability problems. An over-sized FCM may contain concepts that are semantically similar and affects the other concepts in a similar way. This new study introduces a two-stage model reduction approach, and both static and dynamic analysis are considered without losing essential information. In the first stage the number of concepts is reduced by merging similar concepts into clusters, while in the second stage the transformation function parameters of concepts are optimized. In order to show the benefit of using the proposed reduction approach, two sets of studies are conducted. First, a huge set of synthetic FCMs are generated, and the results of these statistical analyses are presented via various tables and figures. Subsequently, suggestions to the decision makers are given. Second, experimental studies are also presented to show the decision parameters and procedure for the proposed approach. The results show that after using the concept reduction approach presented in this study, the interpretability of FCM increases with an acceptable amount of information loss in the output concepts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Truth discovery in mobile crowdsensing has recently received wide attention. It refers to the procedure to estimate the unknown user reliability from collected sensory data while inferring truthful information via quality-aware data aggregation. Though widely studied in the plaintext domain, truth discovery remains largely under-explored in privacy-aware mobile crowdsensing. Existing works either do not consider user reliability issue or fall short of achieving practical cost efficiency, due to iterative transmission and computation over large ciphertexts from homomorphic cryptosystem. In this paper, we propose two new privacy-aware crowdsensing designs with truth discovery that significantly improve the bandwidth and computation performance on individual users. Our insight is to identify the core atomic operation in the iterative truth discovery procedure, and carefully craft security designs accordingly to enable efficient truth discovery in the ciphertext domain. Our first design is highly customized for the single-server setting, while our second design under the two-server model further shifts most of user workloads to the server side. Both our designs protect individual sensory data and reliability degrees throughout the truth discovery procedure. Experiments show that compared with the prior result, our designs gain at least 30&amp;#x00D7; and 10&amp;#x00D7; savings on user communication and computation, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Effective collaboration between student peers is not spontaneous. A system that can measure collaboration in real-time may be useful, as it could alert an instructor to pairs that need help in collaborating effectively. We tested whether superficial measures of speech and user interface actions would suffice for measuring collaboration. Pairs of students solved complex math problems while data were collected in the form of verbal interaction and user action logs from the students&amp;#x2019; tablets. We distinguished four classifications of interactivity: collaboration, cooperation, high asymmetric contribution and low asymmetric contribution. Human coders used richer data (several video streams) to choose one of these codes for each episode. Thousands of features were extracted computationally from the log and audio data. Machine learning was used to induce a detector that also assigned a code to each episode as a function of these features. Detectors for combinations of codes were induced as well. The best detector&amp;#x2019;s overall accuracy was 96% (kappa = 0.92) compared to human coding. This high level of agreement suggests that superficial features of speech and log data do suffice for measuring collaboration. However, these results should be viewed as preliminary because the particular task may have made it relatively easy to distinguish collaboration from cooperation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recently, there is an increasing tendency to embed the functionality of recognizing emotions from the user generated contents, to infer richer profile about the users or contents, that can be used for various automated systems such as call-center operations, recommendations, and assistive technologies. However, to date, adding this functionality was a tedious, costly, and time consuming effort, and one should look for different tools that suits one's needs, and should provide different interfaces to use those tools. The MixedEmotions toolbox leverages the need for such functionalities by providing tools for text, audio, video, and linked data processing within an easily integrable plug-and-play platform. These functionalities include: (i) for text processing: emotion and sentiment recognition, (ii) for audio processing: emotion, age, and gender recognition, (iii) for video processing: face detection and tracking, emotion recognition, facial landmark localization, head pose estimation, face alignment, and body pose estimation, and (iv) for linked data: knowledge graph. Moreover, the MixedEmotions Toolbox is open-source and free. In this article, we present this toolbox in the context of the existing landscape, and provide a range of detailed benchmarks on standardized test-beds showing its state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, three real-world use-cases show its effectiveness, namely emotion-driven smart TV, call center monitoring, and brand reputation analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In an era of ubiquitous large-scale streaming data, the availability of data far exceeds the capacity of expert human analysts. In many settings, such data is either discarded or stored unprocessed in data centers. This paper proposes a method of online data thinning, in which large-scale streaming datasets are winnowed to preserve unique, anomalous, or salient elements for timely expert analysis. At the heart of this proposed approach is an online anomaly detection method based on dynamic, low-rank Gaussian mixture models. Specifically, the high-dimensional covariances matrices associated with the Gaussian components are associated with low-rank models. According to this model, most observations lie near a union of subspaces. The low-rank modeling mitigates the curse of dimensionality associated with anomaly detection for high-dimensional data, and recent advances in subspace clustering and subspace tracking allow the proposed method to adapt to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the proposed method allows subsampling, is robust to missing data, and uses a mini-batch online optimization approach. The resulting algorithms are scalable, efficient, and are capable of operating in real time. Experiments on wide-area motion imagery and e-mail databases illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Traditional cluster ensemble approaches have several limitations. (1) Few make use of prior knowledge provided by experts. (2) It is difficult to achieve good performance in high-dimensional datasets. (3) All of the weight values of the ensemble members are equal, which ignores different contributions from different ensemble members. (4) Not all pairwise constraints contribute to the final result. In the face of this situation, we propose double weighting semi-supervised ensemble clustering based on selected constraint projection(DCECP) to address these limitations. Specifically, DCECP first adopts the random subspace technique in combination with the constraint projection procedure to handle high-dimensional datasets. Second, it treats prior knowledge of experts as pairwise constraints, and assigns different subsets of pairwise constraints to different ensemble members. An adaptive ensemble member weighting process is designed to associate different weight values with different ensemble members. Third, the weighted normalized cut algorithm is adopted to summarize clustering solutions and generate the final result. Finally, nonparametric statistical tests are used to compare multiple algorithms on real-world datasets. Our experiments on 15 high-dimensional datasets show that DCECP performs better than most clustering algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Reduction of end-to-end network delay is an optimization task with applications in multiple domains. Low delays enable improved information flow in social networks, quick spread of ideas in collaboration networks, low travel times for vehicles on road networks and increased rate of packets in the case of communication networks. Delay reduction can be achieved by both improving the propagation capabilities of individual nodes and adding additional edges in the network. One of the main challenges in such network design problems is that the effects of local changes are not independent, and as a consequence, there is a combinatorial search-space of possible improvements. Thus, minimizing the cumulative propagation delay requires novel scalable and data-driven approaches. We consider the problem of network delay minimization via node upgrades. We show that the problem is NP-hard and prove strong inapproximability results about it (i.e. APX-hard) even for equal vertex delays. However, probabilistic approximations for a restricted version of the problem can be obtained. We propose a greedy heuristic which has good quality in practice, but does not scale to very large instances. To enable scalability, we develop approximations for Greedy with probabilistic guarantees. Our methods scale almost linearly with the graph size and consistently outperform competitors in quality. We evaluate our approaches on several real-world graphs from different genres. We achieve up to 2 orders of magnitude speed-up compared to alternatives from the literature on moderate size networks, and obtain high-quality results in minutes on large datasets while competitors from the literature require more than 4 hours.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In modern society, social networks play an important role for online users. However, one unignorable problem behind the booming of the services is privacy issues. At the same time, neural networks have been swiftly developed in recent years, and are proven to be very effective in inference attacks. This paper proposes a new framework for inference attacks in social networks, which smartly integrates and modifies the existing state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. As a result, the framework can fit wider applicable scenarios for inference attacks no matter whether a user has a legit profile image or not. Moreover, the framework is able to boost the existing high-accuracy CNN for sensitive information prediction. In addition to the framework, the paper also shows the detailed configuration of Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) for inference attacks. This part is usually missing in the existing studies. Furthermore, traditional machine learning algorithms are implemented to compare the results from the constructed FCNN. Last but not least, this paper also discusses that applying Differential Privacy (DP) can effectively undermine the accuracy of inference attacks in social networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the prevalence of smart meters, fine-grained sub profiles reveal more information about the aggregated load and further help improve the forecasting accuracy. Ensemble is an effective approach for load forecasting. It either generates multiple training datasets or applies multiple forecasting models to produce multiple forecasts. In this letter, a novel ensemble method is proposed to forecast the aggregated load with sub profiles where the multiple forecasts are produced by different groupings of sub profiles. Specifically, the sub profiles are first clustered into different groups and forecasting is conducted on the grouped load profiles individually. Thus, these forecasts can be summed to form the aggregated load forecast. In this way, different aggregated load forecasts can be obtained by varying the number of clusters. Finally, an optimal weighted ensemble approach is employed to combine these forecasts and provide the final forecasting result. Case studies are conducted on two open datasets and verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>To study the coupling effect of an antenna near the lightning channel when the wireless base station lightning rod is attacked by lightning, the simulation models of lightning channel&amp;#x2013;communication tower and dipole antenna working on the communication frequency of 900 MHz are constructed in this paper based on the CST Studio Suite and FEKO. The results of &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$S_{2,1}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; calculated by the two simulation software are compared to verify the reliability of the models, then the coupling characteristics of the 900 MHz dipole antenna is discussed in terms of the heights of tower, the heights of the antenna, the horizontal distances of the antenna from the tower, and the polarization directions of the antenna. We find that the induced voltage of the antenna in vertical polarization is much larger than that in horizontal polarization. The further the antenna from the base station tower top, the smaller the induced voltage. When the antenna is within the range of 5 m below the tower top with set heights of 30, 25, 20, and 15 m, the induced voltage of the antenna decreases greatly in response to the reduction of antenna&amp;#x0027;s height, and the closer the antenna to the tower, the greater the change. While outside the range, the induced voltage decreases slowly as the antenna&amp;#x0027;s height reduces, until it almost remains unchanged, and the effect of antenna&amp;#x0027;s horizontal distance from the tower on the induced voltage is not obvious. The induced peak voltage of the antenna is almost linearly decreased with its polarization rotation from vertical to horizontal polarization.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we present a novel method for real-time 3D hand pose estimation from single depth images using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Image-based features extracted by 2D CNNs are not directly suitable for 3D hand pose estimation due to the lack of 3D spatial information. Our proposed 3D CNN-based method, taking a 3D volumetric representation of the hand depth image as input and extracting 3D features from the volumetric input, can capture the 3D spatial structure of the hand and accurately regress full 3D hand pose in a single pass. In order to make the 3D CNN robust to variations in hand sizes and global orientations, we perform 3D data augmentation on the training data. To further improve the estimation accuracy, we propose applying the 3D deep network architectures and leveraging the complete hand surface as intermediate supervision for learning 3D hand pose from depth images. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art methods. A cross-dataset experiment also shows that our method has good generalization ability. Furthermore, our method is fast as our implementation runs at over 91 frames per second on a standard computer with a single GPU.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile cloud computing (MCC) as an emerging and prospective computing paradigm, can significantly enhance computation capability and save energy for smart mobile devices (SMDs) by offloading computation-intensive tasks from resourceconstrained SMDs onto resource-rich cloud. However, how to achieve energy-efficient computation offloading under hard constraint for application completion time remains a challenge. To address such a challenge, in this paper, we provide an energy-efficient dynamic offloading and resource scheduling (eDors) policy to reduce energy consumption and shorten application completion time. We first formulate eDors problem into an energy-efficiency cost (EEC) minimization problem while satisfying task-dependency requirement and completion time deadline constraint. We then propose a distributed eDors algorithm consisting of three subalgorithms of computation offloading selection, clock frequency control and transmission power allocation. Next, we show that computation offloading selection depends on not only the computing workload of a task, but also the maximum completion time of its immediate predecessors and the clock frequency and transmission power of the mobile device. Finally, we provide experimental results in a real testbed and demonstrate that eDors algorithm can effectively reduce EEC by optimally adjusting CPU clock frequency of SMDs in local computing, and adapting transmission power for wireless channel conditions in cloud computing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mood disorders, including unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar disorder (BD) [1], are reported to be one of the most common mental illnesses in recent years. In diagnostic evaluation on the outpatients with mood disorder, a large portion of BD patients are initially misdiagnosed as having UD [2]. As most previous research focused on long-term monitoring of mood disorders, short-term detection which could be used in early detection and intervention is thus desirable. This work proposes an approach to short-term detection of mood disorder based on the patterns in emotion of elicited speech responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no database for short-term detection on the discrimination between BD and UD currently. This work collected two databases containing an emotional database (MHMC-EM) collected by the Multimedia Human Machine Communication (MHMC) lab and a mood disorder database (CHI-MEI) collected by the CHI-MEI Medical Center, Taiwan. As the collected CHI-MEI mood disorder database is quite small and emotion annotation is difficult, the MHMC-EM emotional database is selected as a reference database for data adaptation. For the CHI-MEI mood disorder data collection, six eliciting emotional videos are selected and used to elicit the participants&amp;#x0027; emotions. After watching each of the six eliciting emotional video clips, the participants answer the questions raised by the clinician. The speech responses are then used to construct the CHI-MEI mood disorder database. Hierarchical spectral clustering is used to adapt the collected MHMC-EM emotional database to fit the CHI-MEI mood disorder database for dealing with the data bias problem. The adapted MHMC-EM emotional data are then fed to a denoising autoencoder for bottleneck feature extraction. The bottleneck features are used to construct a long short term memory (LSTM)-based emotion detector for generation of emotion profiles from each speech response. The emotion profiles are then cl- stered into emotion codewords using the K-means algorithm. Finally, a class-specific latent affective structure model (LASM) is proposed to model the structural relationships among the emotion codewords with respect to six emotional videos for mood disorder detection. Leave-one-group-out cross validation scheme was employed for the evaluation of the proposed class-specific LASM-based approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed class-specific LASM-based method achieved an accuracy of 73.33% for mood disorder detection, outperforming the classifiers based on SVM and LSTM.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Visual text analytics has recently emerged as one of the most prominent topics in both academic research and the commercial world. To provide an overview of the relevant techniques and analysis tasks, as well as the relationships between them, we comprehensively analyzed 263 visualization papers and 4,346 mining papers published between 1992-2017 in two fields: visualization and text mining. From the analysis, we derived around 300 concepts (visualization techniques, mining techniques, and analysis tasks) and built a taxonomy for each type of concept. The co-occurrence relationships between the concepts were also extracted. Our research can be used as a stepping-stone for other researchers to 1) understand a common set of concepts used in this research topic; 2) facilitate the exploration of the relationships between visualization techniques, mining techniques, and analysis tasks; 3) understand the current practice in developing visual text analytics tools; 4) seek potential research opportunities by narrowing the gulf between visualization and mining techniques based on the analysis tasks; and 5) analyze other interdisciplinary research areas in a similar way. We have also contributed a web-based visualization tool for analyzing and understanding research trends and opportunities in visual text analytics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are man-made devices, which can be implanted in the human body to improve the functioning of various organs. The IMDs monitor and treat physiological condition of the human being (for example, monitoring of blood glucose level by insulin pump). The advancement of information and communication technology (ICT) enhances the communication capabilities of IMDs. In healthcare applications, after mutual authentication, a user (for example, doctor) can access the health data from the IMDs implanted in a patient&amp;#x0027;s body. However, in this kind of communication environment, there are always security and privacy issues such as leakage of health data and malfunctioning of IMDs by an unauthorized access.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Images can convey rich semantics and induce various emotions to viewers. Most existing works on affective image analysis focused on predicting the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. However, such dominant emotion is often insufficient in realworld applications, as the emotions that are induced by an image are highly subjective and different with respect to different viewers. In this paper, we propose to predict the personalized emotion perceptions of images for each individual viewer. Different types of factors that may affect personalized image emotion perceptions, including visual content, social context, temporal evolution, and location influence, are jointly investigated. Rolling multi-task hypergraph learning (RMTHG) is presented to consistently combine these factors and a learning algorithm is designed for automatic optimization. For evaluation, we set up a large scale image emotion dataset from Flickr, named Image-Emotion-Social-Net, on both dimensional and categorical emotion representations with over 1 million images and about 8,000 users. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significant performance gains on personalized emotion classification, as compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have received tremendous attention from scholars in different disciplines, including computer science and civil engineering, as a means to solve complex problems by subdividing them into smaller tasks. The individual tasks are allocated to autonomous entities, known as agents. Each agent decides on a proper action to solve the task using multiple inputs, e.g. history of actions, interactions with its neighbouring agents, and its goal. MAS have found multiple applications including modeling complex systems, smart grids and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by MAS including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of MAS, starting from definitions, features, applications, challenges, and communications to evaluation. A classification on MAS applications and challenges is provided along with references for further studies. We expect this article to serve as an insightful and comprehensive resource on MAS for researchers and practitioners in the area.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes a framework and its mathematical model for optimal routing and charging of an electric vehicle fleet for high-efficiency dynamic transit systems, while taking into account energy efficiency and charging price. Based on an extended pickup and delivery problem, an optimization model is formulated from the transit service providers&amp;#x2019; perspective and is applied to an electric vehicle fleet with economically efficient but small batteries in very urbanized areas. It aims to determine the best route from the origin to the final destination for each electric vehicle to satisfy the welfare of all passengers (e.g. travel time and passengers&amp;#x2019; travel distance), while maximizing the energy efficiency (e.g. by reducing fuel and charging cost), subject to local/global constraints (e.g. EV charging station availability, battery state-of-charge dynamics). This optimization model is solved as a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming problem. This paper also explore the potential impact of EV fleet of dynamic commuter transit services on electric distribution systems, such as increased average load.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In order to make machines more intelligent, it is inevitable to understand human-like cognitive development, in which adaptive, autonomous and progressive evolution of cognitive decision-making in interacting with the environment plays a key role. Inspired by enactive artificial intelligence and evolutionary sampling learning, a new cognitive development learning model termed evolutionary enactive learning is proposed in this work. The proposed model is constructed by extending the reinforcement learning framework and introducing the utility-selection theory to guide the coevolution of pattern representation and decision-making policies. Theoretical analysis on the model&amp;#x2019;s validity of evolutionary enactive learning is given. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two simulated cognitive decision-making tasks are designed, in which pattern representation and decision-making must be jointly developed to achieve good cognitive performance. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that the resulting learning process is rational and effective. Finally, we indicate that the proposed evolutionary enactive learning could be readily further extended by introducing existing machine learning techniques to solve more practical applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Real-time accurate recommendation of large-scale recommender systems is a challenging task. Matrix factorization (MF), as one of the most accurate and scalable techniques to predict missing ratings, has become popular in the collaborative filtering (CF) community. Currently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most famous approaches for MF. However, it is non-trivial to parallelize SGD for large-scale problems due to the dependence on the user and item pair, which can cause parallelization over-writing. To remove the dependence on the user and item pair, we propose a multi-stream SGD (MSGD) approach, for which the updating process is theoretically convergent. On that basis, we propose a CUDA (compute Unified Device Architecture) parallelization MSGD (CUMSGD) approach. CUMSGD can obtain high parallelism and scalability on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). On Tesla K20m and K40c GPUs, the experimental results show that CUMSGD outperforms prior works that accelerated MF on shared memory systems, e.g., DSGD, FPSGD, Hogwild!, and CCD++. For large-scale CF problems, we propose multiple GPUs (multi-GPU) CUMSGD (MCUMSGD). The experimental results show that MCUMSGD can improve MSGD performance further.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we propose a novel online multimodal multi-expert learning algorithm for social event tracking. Compared with existing methods, the proposed model has several advantages: (1) It adopts a novel multi-expert minimization restoration scheme and allows the tracked model to evolve backwards to undo undesirable model updates, which is to obtain their informative summary details and the evolutionary trends of social events over time. (2) It has a non-parametric online multi-modal tracking module, which is able to not only automatically learn the number of topics from data over time, but also exploit the multi-modal property of social event. (3) It is able to not only effectively track multi-modal social event, but also automatically exploit the evolutionary process of social event for deep understanding with multi-modal topics. To evaluate the proposed model, we collect a real world dataset for research on social event tracking with multi-modality information, and will release it for academic use. We have conducted extensive experiments, and both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>High market uncertainty impedes an entrepreneur&amp;#x2019;s ability to evaluate the state of the market for a business opportunity. For many entrepreneurial ventures, data collection and analysis techniques and technologies are becoming an important source to manage uncertainty. This trend is often referred to as &amp;#x201C;data-driven entrepreneurship.&amp;#x201D; We consider a dynamic approach using data to overcome market uncertainty for business opportunity-related evaluations. In particular, we examine the entrepreneur&amp;#x2019;s investment portfolio in which each investment generates expected returns and some information about a specific aspect of the market for a single business opportunity. We develop a model that analyzes imperfect market data (e.g., financial, social, regulatory), while factoring in the entrepreneur&amp;#x2019;s risk preference and operational shortages of resources, routines, reputation, and regulations. Our numerical findings show that, rather than pursuing the highest expected returns, an entrepreneur may choose perfect information, risk hedging, or market-controlling investments based on his/her cash level and risk preference. Hence, the entrepreneur, fueled by the availability of data analysis, could overcome uncertainties and obtain better insights for business opportunity decisions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>While accurately predicting mood and wellbeing could have a number of important clinical benefits, traditional machine learning (ML) methods frequently yield low performance in this domain. We posit that this is because a one-size-fits-all machine learning model is inherently ill-suited to predicting outcomes like mood and stress, which vary greatly due to individual differences. Therefore, we employ Multitask Learning (MTL) techniques to train personalized ML models which are customized to the needs of each individual, but still leverage data from across the population. Three formulations of MTL are compared: i) MTL deep neural networks, which share several hidden layers but have final layers unique to each task; ii) Multi-task Multi-Kernel learning, which feeds information across tasks through kernel weights on feature types; and iii) a Hierarchical Bayesian model in which tasks share a common Dirichlet Process prior. We offer the code for this work in open source. These techniques are investigated in the context of predicting future mood, stress, and health using data collected from surveys, wearable sensors, smartphone logs, and the weather. Empirical results demonstrate that using MTL to account for individual differences provides large performance improvements over traditional machine learning methods and provides personalized, actionable insights.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Location-based Services (LBS) have gained popularity as a result of the advances in mobile and communication technologies. LBS provide users with relevant information based on their location. In spite of the desirable features provided by LBS, the geographic locations of users are not adequately protected. Location privacy is one of the major challenges in vehicular and mobile networks. In this article, we analyse the security and privacy requirements for LBS in vehicular and mobile networks. Specifically, this paper covers privacy enhancing technologies and cryptographic approaches that provide location privacy in vehicular and mobile networks. The different approaches proposed in literature are compared and open research areas are identified.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Computationally modelling the affective content of images has been extensively studied recently because of its wide applications in entertainment, advertisement, and education. Significant progress has been made on designing discriminative features to bridge the affective gap. Assuming that viewers can reach a consensus on the emotion of images, most existing works focused on assigning the dominant emotion category or the average dimension values to an image. However, the image emotions perceived by viewers are subjective by nature with the influence of personal and situational factors. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach that characterizes the categorical image emotions as a discrete probability distribution (DPD). To associate emotion with the visual features extracted from images, we present shared sparse learning to learn the combination coefficients, with which the DPD of an unseen image is predicted by linearly combining the DPDs of the training images. Furthermore, we extend our method to the setup where multi-features are available and learn the optimal weights for each feature to reflect the importance of different features. Extensive experiments are carried out on Abstract, Emotion6 and IESN datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the last decade Web advertising has rapidly grown, becoming one of the major profit source for web-based businesses.One of the main challenges is the creation of effective and engaging advertisements able to attract potential customers on the product websites, leading them just one step before the product purchasing.A promising solution is the combination of user preferences from the content provided in social media and the extraction of significant aspects discussed on review websites.In this paper, we propose a 3-phase model for the content analysis from product review sites, which considers in tandem (i) the aspects discussed by users on reviews websites, (ii) the opinions' polarity associated with such aspects, and (iii) the user profile on social networks aiming at the detection of the most ``interesting' aspects and at using them for generating attractive messages.The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated in a real-world scenario by working with two Twitter seeds about domain-specific magazines and the data of the respective followers.Results demonstrates how the messages created by analyzing the content (i.e. products' aspects and associated polarities) provided by a specific community improves the overall attractiveness of the generated advertisements.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Multiview clustering, which aims at using multiple distinct feature sets to boost clustering performance, has a wide range of applications. A subspace-based approach, a type of widely used methods, learns unified embedding from multiple sources of information and gives a relatively good performance. However, these methods usually ignore data similarity rankings; for example, example A may be more similar to B than C, and such similarity triplets may be more effective in revealing the data cluster structure. Motivated by recent embedding methods for modeling knowledge graph in natural-language processing, this paper proposes to mimic different views as different relations in a knowledge graph for unified and view-specific embedding learning. Moreover, in real applications, it happens so often that some views suffer from missing information, leading to incomplete multiview data. Under such a scenario, the performance of conventional multiview clustering degenerates notably, whereas the method we propose here can be naturally extended for incomplete multiview clustering, which enables full use of examples with incomplete feature sets for model promotion. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art clustering methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper focuses on understanding the robustness of a supply network in the face of a disruption. We propose a decision support system for analyzing the robustness of supply chain networks against disruptions using topological analysis, performance measurement relevant to a supply chain context, and an optimization for increasing supply network performance. The topology of a supply chain network has considerable implications for its robustness in the presence of disruptions. The system allows decision makers to evaluate topologies of their supply chain networks in a variety of disruption scenarios, thereby proactively managing the supply chain network to understand vulnerabilities of the network before a disruption occurs. Our system calculates performance measurements for a supply chain network in the face of disruptions and provides both topological metrics (through network analysis) and operational metrics (through an optimization model). Through an example application, we evaluate the impact of random and targeted disruptions on the robustness of a supply chain network.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Scalable causal discovery is an essential technology to a wide spectrum of applications, including biomedical studies and social network evolution analysis. To tackle the difficulty of high dimensionality, a number of solutions are proposed in the literature, generally dividing the original variable domain into smaller subdomains by computation intensive partitioning strategies. These approaches usually suffer significant structural errors when the partitioning strategies fail to recognize true causal edges across the output subdomains. Such a structural error accumulates quickly with the growing depth of recursive partitioning, due to the lack of correction mechanism over causally connected variables when they are wrongly divided into two subdomains, finally jeopardizing the robustness of the integrated results. This paper proposes a completely different strategy to solve the problem, powered by a lightweight random partitioning scheme together with a carefully designed merging algorithm over results from the random partitions. Based on the randomness properties of the partitioning scheme, we design a suite of tricks for the merging algorithm, in order to support propagation-based significance enhancement, maximal acyclic subgraph causal ordering, and order-sensitive redundancy elimination. Theoretical studies as well as empirical evaluations verify the genericity, effectiveness, and scalability of our proposal on both simulated and real-world causal structures when the scheme is used in combination with a variety of causal solvers known effective on smaller domains.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained popularity as an important means to evaluate students&amp;#x0027; ability. Assigning tags to test questions is crucial in CAT. Manual tagging is widely used for constructing question banks; however, this approach is time-consuming and might lead to consistency issues. Automatic question tagging, an alternative, has not been studied extensively. In this paper, we propose a position-based attention model and keywords-based model to automatically tag questions with knowledge units. With regard to multiple-choice questions, the proposed models employ mechanisms to capture useful information from keywords to enhance tagging performance. Unlike traditional machine learning-based tagging methods, our models utilize deep neural networks to represent questions using contextual information. The experimental results show that our proposed models outperform some traditional classification and topic methods by a large margin on an English question bank dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Polarity classification is a well-known Sentiment Analysis task. However, most research has been oriented towards developing supervised or unsupervised systems without paying much attention to certain linguistic phenomena such as negation. In this paper we focus on this specific issue in order to demonstrate that dealing with negation can improve the final system. Although we can find some studies of negation detection, most of them deal with English documents. On the contrary, our study is focused on the scope of negation in Spanish Sentiment Analysis. Thus, we have built an unsupervised polarity classification system based on integrating external knowledge. In order to evaluate the influence of negation we have implemented a specific module for negation detection by applying several rules. The system has been tested considering and without considering negation, using a corpus of tweets written in Spanish. The results obtained reveal that the treatment of negation can greatly improve the accuracy of the final system. Moreover, we have carried out a comprehensive statistical study in order to demonstrate our approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which statistically demonstrates that taking into account negation significantly improves the polarity classification of Spanish tweets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The problem of predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its one-dimensional sequence has been called the &amp;#x201C;holy grail of molecular biology&amp;#x201D;, and it has become an important part of structural genomics projects. Despite the rapid developments in computer technology and computational intelligence, it remains challenging and fascinating. In this paper, to solve it we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. We decompose the protein energy function Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics force fields into bond and non-bond energies as the first and second objectives. Considering the effect of solvent, we innovatively adopt a solvent-accessible surface area as the third objective. We use sixty-six benchmark proteins to verify the proposed method and obtain better or competitive results in comparison with the existing methods. The results suggest the necessity to incorporate the effect of solvent into the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to improve protein structure prediction in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Objective measurements of engagement are increasingly sought after by both the media industry and scholar communities to explain what drives people to consume audiovisual contents. However, engagement is a complex construct that, at the psychological level, has been mainly operationalised through indicators of attentional and emotional processes, often overlooking motivational factors. We claim that in the context of news consumption, motivation, operationalised as intrinsic interest for consuming a given content, needs to be factored in together with attentional and emotional processes. The present work provides an objective metric for motivation based on electroencephalographic (EEG) registration of users&amp;#x2019; neural activity, while they read sets of news pre-classified in terms of their potential interest. We focus on a metric that has been used as an indicator of the degree to which an item or event induces the motivation to approach or escape, the so called frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). Moreover, in addition to the traditional approach to the analysis of EEG signals, we also introduce a more novel technique based on estimating the entropy of the signals. Results confirm that FAA is indeed a good proxy for objective monitoring of interest in media contents and that entropy analysis, although its interpretation in terms of information processing warrants further investigation, is also sensitive to the manipulation of interest, providing results that complement traditional power spectrum analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Spambot detection in online social networks is a long-lasting challenge involving the study and design of detection techniques capable of efficiently identifying ever-evolving spammers. Recently, a new wave of social spambots has emerged, with advanced human-like characteristics that allow them to go undetected even by current state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we show that efficient spambots detection can be achieved via an in-depth analysis of their collective behaviors exploiting the digital DNA technique for modeling the behaviors of social network users. Inspired by its biological counterpart, in the digital DNA representation the behavioral lifetime of a digital account is encoded in a sequence of characters. Then, we define a similarity measure for such digital DNA sequences. We build upon digital DNA and the similarity between groups of users to characterize both genuine accounts and spambots. Leveraging such characterization, we design the Social Fingerprinting technique, which is able to discriminate among spambots and genuine accounts in both a supervised and an unsupervised fashion. We finally evaluate the effectiveness of Social Fingerprinting and we compare it with three state-of-the-art detection algorithms. Among the peculiarities of our approach is the possibility to apply off-the-shelf DNA analysis techniques to study online users behaviors and to efficiently rely on a limited number of lightweight account characteristics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile display has become one of the most power-hungry component in mobile video viewing. Currently, mobile devices can reduce the display energy by performing dynamic brightness scaling (DBS) under the distortion constraint of video signals. We observe that there is a pitfall preventing current practice from systematic display energy reduction. In particular, existing objective DBS schemes lack direct connection to the subjective human perception on DBS-enabled videos, which is the key to achieving human-centered energy-experience optimization. To overcome this pitfall, we present CrowdDBS, a crowdsourced display energy reduction framework for mobile video viewing. CrowdDBS is empowered by a set of crowdsourcing studies that uncover the relationship between human perception and DBS frequency, magnitude, and temporal consistency, respectively. Motivated by the insights obtained from these studies, CrowdDBS employs a suit of designs and a DBS optimization framework to optimize the energy-experience tradeoff in mobile video viewing. Comprehensive experimental results and user evaluations under a variety of practical settings show that CrowdDBS can achieve 37% device energy reduction on average while guaranteeing satisfactory user experience in mobile video viewing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile payment apps are seeing explosive usage worldwide. This paper focuses on Venmo, a very popular mobile person-to-person (P2P) payment service owned by Paypal. Venmo allows money transfers between users with a mandatory transaction note. More than half of transaction records in Venmo are public information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Location Inference (MLLI) technique to infer user locations from public transaction records in Venmo. MLLI explores two observations. First, many Venmo transaction notes contain implicit location cues. Second, the types and temporal patterns of user transactions have strong ties to their location closeness. With a large dataset of 2.12M users and 20.23M Venmo transaction records, we show that MLLI can identify the top-1, top-3, and top-5 possible locations for a Venmo user with accuracy up to 50%, 80%, and 90%, respectively. Our results highlight the danger of sharing transaction notes on Venmo or similar mobile payment apps.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>For efficient network investments, insight in the expected spatial spread of new load and generation units is of prime importance. This paper presents and applies a method to determine key factors for adoption of photovoltaics, electric vehicles and heat pumps. Using a logistic regression analysis the impact of geographical and socio-economic factors on adoption probabilities of these new energy technologies is quantified. Income level, average age and household composition are shown to be important factors. Additionally for photovoltaics, peer effects were also shown to significantly influence the likelihood of adoption. The implementation of the developed models and the achievable improvement in prediction accuracy is demonstrated by application to a scenario study based on historical data. The models can be incorporated in future energy scenarios to provide a probabilistic spatial forecast of future penetration levels of the mentioned technologies and identify key areas of interest.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Energy storage systems (ESS) have adopted a new role with the increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RES). EVs introduce new charging demands that change the traditional demand profiles and RES are characterized by their high variability. This paper presents a new multistage distribution expansion planning model where investments in distribution network assets, RES, ESS and EV charging stations (EVCS) are jointly considered. The charging demand necessary for EVs transportation is performed using a vehicle model based on travel patterns. The variability associated with RES along with the demand requires the incorporation of uncertainty, which is characterized through a set of scenarios. These scenarios are generated by the k-means++ clustering technique that allows keeping the correlation in the information of the uncertainty sources. The resulting stochastic program is driven by the minimization of the present value of the total expected cost including investment, maintenance, production, losses and non-supplied energy. The associated scenario-based deterministic equivalent is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which can be solved by commercial software. Numerical results are presented for an illustrative 54-node test system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this work, we study students' learning effectiveness through their use of a homegrown innovative educational technology, Web Programming Grading Assistant (WPGA), which facilitates grading and feedback delivery of paper-based assessments. We designed a lab study and a classroom study from a lower-division blended-instruction computer science course. We evaluated a partial credit assignment algorithm. We tracked and modeled students&amp;#x2019; learning behaviors through their use of WPGA. Results showed that students demonstrated an effort and desire to review assessments regardless of if they were graded for academic performance or for attendance. Diligent students achieved higher exam scores on average and were found to review their exams and the correct questions frequently. Additionally, student cohorts exhibited similar initial reviewing patterns, but different in-depth reviewing and reflecting strategies. Ultimately, the work contributes to multidimensional learning analytics aggregation across the physical and cybersphere.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Unit visualizations are a family of visualizations where every data item is represented by a unique visual mark&amp;#x2014;a visual unit&amp;#x2014;during visual encoding. For certain datasets and tasks, unit visualizations can provide more information, better match the user&amp;#x0027;s mental model, and enable novel interactions compared to traditional aggregated visualizations. Current visualization grammars cannot fully describe the unit visualization family. In this paper, we characterize the design space of unit visualizations to derive a grammar that can express them. The resulting grammar is called ATOM, and is based on passing data through a series of layout operations that divide the output of previous operations recursively until the size and position of every data point can be determined. We evaluate the expressive power of the grammar by both using it to describe existing unit visualizations, as well as to suggest new unit visualizations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Visual realism is defined as the extent to which an image appears to people as a photo rather than computer generated. Assessing visual realism is important in applications like computer graphics rendering and photo retouching. However, current realism evaluation approaches use either labor-intensive human judgments or automated algorithms largely dependent on comparing renderings to reference images. We develop a reference-free computational framework for visual realism prediction to overcome these constraints. First, we construct a benchmark dataset of 2520 images with comprehensive human annotated attributes. From statistical modeling on this data, we identify image attributes most relevant for visual realism. We propose both empirically-based (guided by our statistical modeling of human data) and CNN-learned features to predict visual realism of images. Our framework has the following advantages: (1) it creates an interpretable and concise empirical model that characterizes human perception of visual realism; (2) it links computational features to latent factors of human image perception.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Online reviews have become an important source of information for users before making an informed purchase decision. Early reviews of a product tend to have a high impact on the subsequent product sales. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the behavior characteristics of early reviewers through their posted reviews on two real-world large e-commerce platforms, i.e., Amazon and Yelp. In specific, we divide product lifetime into three consecutive stages, namely early, majority and laggards. A user who has posted a review in the early stage is considered as an early reviewer. We quantitatively characterize early reviewers based on their rating behaviors, the helpfulness scores received from others and the correlation of their reviews with product popularity. We have found that (1) an early reviewer tends to assign a higher average rating score; and (2) an early reviewer tends to post more helpful reviews. Our analysis of product reviews also indicates that early reviewers&amp;#x0027; ratings and their received helpfulness scores are likely to influence product popularity. By viewing review posting process as a multiplayer competition game, we propose a novel margin-based embedding model for early reviewer prediction. Extensive experiments on two different e-commerce datasets have shown that our proposed approach outperforms a number of competitive baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The intelligence of Smart Cities (SC) is represented by its ability in collecting, managing, integrating, analyzing and mining multi-source data for valuable insights. In order to harness multi-source data for an informed place design, this paper presents &quot;Public Sentiments and Activities in Places&quot; multi-source data analysis flow (PSAP) in an Informed Design Platform (IDP). In terms of key contributions, PSAP implements 1) an Interconnected Data Model (IDM) to manage multi-source data independently and integrally, 2) an efficient and effective data mining mechanism based on multi-dimension and multi-measure queries (MMQs), and 3) concurrent data processing cascades with Sentiments in Places Analysis Mechanism (SPAM) and Activities in Places Analysis Mechanism (APAM), to fuse social network data with other data on public sentiment and activity comprehensively. As proved by a holistic evaluation, both SPAM and APAM outperform compared methods. Specifically, SPAM improves its classification accuracy gradually and significantly from 72.37% to about 85% within 9 crowd-calibration cycles, and APAM with an ensemble classifier achieves the highest precision of 92.13%, which is approximately 13% higher than the second best method. Finally, by applying MMQs on &quot;Sentiment&amp;Activity Linked Data&quot;, various place design insights of our testbed are mined to improve its livability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Effective location recommendation is an important problem in both research and industry. Much research has focused on personalized recommendation for users. However, there are more uses such as site selection for firms and factories. In this study, we try to solve site selection problem by recommending some locations satisfying special requirements. There are many factors affecting it, including functions of architecture, building cost, pollution discharge etc. We focus on the specific site selection of meteorological observation stations in this paper with leveraging the factors of functions of architecture and building cost from multi-source urban big data. We consider not only recommending the locations that can provide more accuracy prediction and cover more areas, but also minimizing the cost of building new stations. We design an extensible two-stage framework for the station placing including prediction model and recommendation model. It is very convenient for executives to add more real-life factors into our approach. We have some empirical findings and evaluate the proposed approach using the real meteorological data of Shaanxi province, China. Experiment results show the better performance of our approach than existing commonly used methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Dynamic networks naturally appear in a multitude of applications from different fields. Analyzing and exploring dynamic networks in order to understand and detect patterns and phenomena is challenging, fostering the development of new methodologies, particularly in the field of visual analytics. In this work, we propose a novel visual analytics methodology for dynamic networks, which relies on the spectral graph wavelet theory. We enable the automatic analysis of a signal defined on the nodes of the network, making viable the robust detection of network properties. Specifically, we use a fast approximation of a graph wavelet transform to derive a set of wavelet coefficients, which are then used to identify activity patterns on large networks, including their temporal recurrence. The coefficients naturally encode the spatial and temporal variations of the signal, leading to an efficient and meaningful representation. This methodology allows for the exploration of the structural evolution of the network and their patterns over time. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using usage scenarios and comparisons involving real dynamic networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of information network, the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) is an irreversible trend, and the intelligent demands for IoT is becoming more and more urgent. How to improve the cognitive ability of IoT is a new challenge and therefore has given rise to the emergence of Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT). In this paper, a device level multimodal data correlation mining (DMDC) model is firstly designed based on the CCA to transform the data feature into a subspace and analyze the data correlation. The correlation of the device is obtained based on the comprehensive of data correlation and the location information of the device. Then a heterogeneous clustering model (HDC) is proposed by using the result of the correlation analysis to classify the device. Finally, we propose a device clustering algorithm based on multimodal data correlation (DCMDC) for CIoT, which combines the functions of multimodal data correlation analyze with device clustering. Extensive simulations are carried out and our results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the quality of data transmission and the intelligent service.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper is an extension of the work that was originally reported in [1]. In this paper, we propose a novel method of summarizing lecture slides to enhance preview efficiency and improve students&amp;#x2019; understanding of the content. Students are often asked to prepare for a class by reading lecture materials. However, this does not always produce good results because the attention span of students is limited. We conducted a survey involving preview of lecture materials by more than 300 students and found that they want summarized materials to preview. Therefore, we developed an automatic summarization method to reduce the original preview materials to a summarized set. Our approach is based on the use of image processing and text processing to extract important pages from lecture materials, and then optimizing the selection of pages in accordance with a specified preview time. We applied the proposed summarization method to lecture slides. In our user study involving more than 300 students, we compared the relative effectiveness of the summarized slides and the original materials in terms of quiz scores, preview achievement ratio, and time spent previewing. We found that students who previewed the summarized slides achieved better scores on pre-lecture quizzes even though they spent less time previewing the material.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Crowdsourcing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, buildings, and human. Especially, nowadays, no countries, no communities, and no person are immune to urban emergency events. Detection about urban emergency events, e.g., fires, storms, traffic jams is of great importance to protect the security of humans. Recently, social media feeds are rapidly emerging as a novel platform for providing and dissemination of information that is often geographic. The content from social media usually includes references to urban emergency events occurring at, or affecting specific locations. In this paper, in order to detect and describe the real time urban emergency event, the 5W (What, Where, When, Who, and Why) model is proposed. Firstly, users of social media are set as the target of crowd sourcing. Secondly, the spatial and temporal information from the social media are extracted to detect the real time event. Thirdly, a GIS based annotation of the detected urban emergency event is shown. The proposed method is evaluated with extensive case studies based on real urban emergency events. The results show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Background:Cross project defect prediction (CPDP) recently gained considerable attention, yet there are no systematic efforts to analyse existing empirical evidence. Objective:To synthesise literature to understand the state-of-the-art in CPDP with respect to metrics, models, data approaches, datasets and associated performances. Further, we aim to assess the performance of CPDP vs. within project DP models. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review. Results from primary studies are synthesised (thematic, meta-analysis) to answer research questions. Results: We identified 30 primary studies passing quality assessment. Performance measures, except precision, vary with the choice of metrics. Recall, precision, f-measure, and AUC are the most common measures. Models based on Nearest-Neighbour and Decision Tree tend to perform well in CPDP, whereas the popular naive Bayes yield average performance. Performance of ensembles varies greatly across f-measure and AUC. Data approaches address CPDP challenges using row/column processing, which improve CPDP in terms of recall at the cost of precision. This is observed in multiple occasions including the meta-analysis of CPDP vs. WPDP. NASA and Jureczko datasets seem to favour CPDP over WPDP more frequently. Conclusion: CPDP is still a challenge and requires more research before trustworthy applications can take place. We provide guidelines for further research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) systems aggregate the collected intelligence of all users to provide satisfying answers for questions. Previous works use reputation systems to achieve the goals. However, these reputation systems evaluate a user with an overall rating for all questions the user has answered regardless of the question categories, thus the reputation score does not accurately reflect the user&amp;#x0027;s ability to answer a question in a specific category. We propose SmartQ: a reputation based Q&amp;A System. SmartQ employs a category and theme based reputation management system to evaluate users&amp;#x0027; willingness and capability to answer various kinds of questions. The reputation system facilitates the forwarding of a question to favorable experts, which improves the question response rate and answer quality. Our trace-driven simulation on PeerSim demonstrates the effectiveness of SmartQ in providing good user experience. We then develop a real application of SmartQ and deploy it for use in a student group in Clemson University. The user feedback shows that SmartQ can provide high-quality answers for users in a community.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid growth of the social network, information overload becomes a critical issue. Service providers push a lot of redundant contents and advertisements to users every day. Thus, users&amp;#x2019; interests and the probability of reading them have dropped considerably and the network load is wasted. To address this issue, accurate content push is needed, where the main challenges are proving precise descriptions of users and supporting the big data nature of users and contents. Content-centric networking (CCN) has emerged as a new network architecture to meet today&amp;#x2019;s requirement for content access and delivery. By using the named content, CCN makes it possible to track users&amp;#x2019; real-time interests and motivates us studying a novel content accurate push (or called content recommendation) system. In this paper, we model this issue as a novel contextual multiarmed bandit based Monte Carlo tree search problem and propose a big data support online learning algorithm to meet the demand of content push with low cost. To avoid destroying CCN&amp;#x2019;s energy efficient feature, the energy consumption is considered into our module. Then, we theoretically prove that our online learning algorithm achieves sublinear regret bound and sublinear storage, which is very efficient in the big data context and do not increase the network burden. Experiments in an offline collected dataset show that our approach significantly increases the accuracy and convergence speed against other state-of-the-art bandit algorithms and can overcome the cold start problem as well.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>People form first impressions about the personalities of unfamiliar individuals even after very brief interactions with them. In this study we present and evaluate several models that mimic this automatic social behavior. Specifically, we present several models trained on a large dataset of short YouTube video blog posts for predicting apparent Big Five personality traits of people and whether they seem suitable to be recommended to a job interview. Along with presenting our audiovisual approach and results that won the third place in the ChaLearn First Impressions Challenge, we investigate modeling in different modalities including audio only, visual only, language only, audiovisual, and combination of audiovisual and language. Our results demonstrate that the best performance could be obtained using a fusion of all data modalities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The widespread popularity of smart meters enables an immense amount of fine-grained electricity consumption data to be collected. Meanwhile, the deregulation of the power industry, particularly on the delivery side, has continuously been moving forward worldwide. How to employ massive smart meter data to promote and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the power grid is a pressing issue. To date, substantial works have been conducted on smart meter data analytics. To provide a comprehensive overview of the current research and to identify challenges for future research, this paper conducts an application-oriented review of smart meter data analytics. Following the three stages of analytics, namely, descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics, we identify the key application areas as load analysis, load forecasting, and load management. We also review the techniques and methodologies adopted or developed to address each application. In addition, we also discuss some research trends, such as big data issues, novel machine learning technologies, new business models, the transition of energy systems, and data privacy and security.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many countries are suffering from severe air pollution. Understanding how different air pollutants accumulate and propagate is critical to making relevant public policies. In this paper, we use urban big data (air quality data and meteorological data) to identify the spatiotemporal (ST) causal pathways for air pollutants. This problem is challenging because: (1) there are numerous noisy and low-pollution periods in the raw air quality data, which may lead to unreliable causality analysis; (2) for large-scale data in the ST space, the computational complexity of constructing a causal structure is very high; and (3) the ST causal pathways are complex due to the interactions of multiple pollutants and the influence of environmental factors. Therefore, we present pg-Causality, a novel pattern-aided graphical causality analysis approach that combines the strengths of pattern mining and Bayesian learning to efficiently identify the ST causal pathways. First, pattern mining helps suppress the noise by capturing frequent evolving patterns (FEPs) of each monitoring sensor, and greatly reduce the complexity by selecting the pattern-matched sensors as &amp;#x201C;causers&amp;#x201D;. Then, Bayesian learning carefully encodes the local and ST causal relations with a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN)-based graphical model, which also integrates environmental influences to minimize biases in the final results. We evaluate our approach with three real-world data sets containing 982 air quality sensors in 128 cities, in three regions of China from 01-Jun-2013 to 31-Dec-2016. Results show that our approach outperforms the traditional causal structure learning methods in time efficiency, inference accuracy and interpretability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this research was to investigate how humans would respond to unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) operating in their environment. These environments included a shopping mall, two different sports complexes, and a university campus setting. The field study included video observations of 784 pedestrians. Additionally, survey data were collected and matched to 115 pedestrian observations. The field evaluations were conducted over a period of six weeks at the four locations. The results indicate that of the 784 pedestrians observed, 63.5&amp;#x0025; took time to observe the robot, 30.6&amp;#x0025; ignored the robot, and 5.9&amp;#x0025; stopped and interacted with the robot. Based on the individual results from the 115 pedestrians that completed the survey, those who indicated having positive feelings (e.g., strong, comfortable, excited) had an increased likelihood of interacting with the UGV. If the pedestrian had owned a dog they were more likely to interact with the robot. Pedestrians traveling in groups were also more likely to stop and interact with the robot than those traveling alone. The results from this field research will be used in the near future to inform the development of a pedestrian model to include responses to robots that may be in the environment, and could also be used to inform design features for UGVs. As robots continue to become more prevalent in society, it is important to consider how humans will interact with them when encountered.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Web application attacks constitute considerable security threats to computer networks and end users. Existing threat detection methods are mostly designed on signature-based approaches which cannot recognise zero-day vulnerabilities. Moreover, with the minimal availability of real-world web attack data, the effectiveness of such approaches is limited further. In this paper, we propose an architectural scheme for designing a threat intelligence technique for web attacks to address these challenges through a four-step methodology: 1) collecting web attack data by crawling websites and accumulating network traffic for representing this data as feature vectors; 2) dynamically extracting important features using the Association Rule Mining (ARM) algorithm; 3) using these extracted features to simulate web attack data; and 4) proposing a new Outlier Gaussian Mixture (OGM) technique for detecting known as well as zero-day attacks based on the anomaly detection methodology. The performance of the scheme is appraised using two well-known datasets, namely, the Web Attack and UNSW-NB15 datasets. The empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms four other competing machine learning mechanisms in terms of detection rate and false alarm rates on both the original as well as simulated web data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Extracting knowledge from sensor data for various purposes has received a great deal of attention by the data mining community. For the purpose of event detection in cyber-physical systems (CPS), e.g., damage in building or aerospace vehicles from the continuous arriving data is challenging due to the detection quality. Traditional data mining schemes are used to reduce data that often use metrics, association rules, and binary values for frequent patterns as indicators for finding interesting knowledge about an event. However, these may not be directly applicable to the network due to certain constraints (communication, computation, bandwidth). We discover that, the indicators may not reveal meaningful information for event detection in practice. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive data mining framework for event detection in the CPS named DPminer, which functions in a distributed and parallel manner (data in a partitioned database processed by one or more sensor processors) and is able to extract a pattern of sensors that may have event information with a low communication cost. To achieve this, we introduce a new sensor behavioral pattern mining technique called differential sensor pattern (DSP) which considers different frequencies and values (non-binary) with a set of sensors, instead of traditional binary patterns. We present an algorithm for data preparation and then use a highly-compact data tree structure (called DP-Tree) for generating the DSP. An important tradeoff between the communication and computation costs for the event detection via data mining is made. Evaluation results show that DPminer can be very useful for networked sensing with a superior performance in terms of communication cost and event detection quality compared to existing data mining schemes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this article, state of the art on virtual reality (VR) for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with a focus on training/targeted intervention is discussed and reflected upon to explore areas for more future benefits. We present advantages of VR for individuals with ASD. We identify challenges and design issues for future training applications regarding individuals with ASD. We discuss and present design guidelines accumulated in the literature so far, mostly based on observations in user studies exploring the usefulness of VR as a training tool for individuals with ASD, with a systematic literature review. We present and apply a new taxonomy that classifies previous VR works on training individuals with ASD according to immersive and regular (non-immersive) VR systems and types of social, life and safety skills based on a systematic literature review. We explore the common design considerations of the previous VR studies for training individuals with ASD. Finally, based on the systematic literature reviews, we identify key gaps in the research on this topic and present future research considerations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Context: The proper management of people can help software organisations to achieve higher levels of success. However, the limited attention paid to the appropriate use of theories to underpin the research in this area leaves it unclear how to deal with human aspects of software engineers, such as motivation and satisfaction. Objectives: This article aims to expose what drives the motivation and satisfaction of software engineers at work. Methods: A multiple case study was conducted at four software organisations in Brazil. For 11 months, data was collected using semi-structured interviews, diary studies, and document analyses. Results: The Theory of Motivation and Satisfaction of Software Engineers (TMS-SE), presented in this article, combines elements from well established theories with new findings, and translates them into the software engineering context. Conclusion: The TMS-SE advances the understanding of people management in the software engineering field and presents a strong conceptual framework for future investigations in this area.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Distributing data over multiple cloud storage providers automatically provides users with a certain degree of information leakage control, for no single point of attack can leak all the information. However, unplanned distribution of data chunks can lead to high information disclosure even while using multiple clouds. In this paper, we study an important information leakage problem caused by unplanned data distribution in multicloud storage services. Then, we present StoreSim, an information leakage aware storage system in multicloud. StoreSim aims to store syntactically similar data on the same cloud, thus minimizing the user&amp;#x0027;s information leakage across multiple clouds. We design an approximate algorithm to efficiently generate similarity-preserving signatures for data chunks based on MinHash and Bloom filter, and also design a function to compute the information leakage based on these signatures. Next, we present an effective storage plan generation algorithm based on clustering for distributing data chunks with minimal information leakage across multiple clouds. Finally, we evaluate our scheme using two real datasets from Wikipedia and GitHub. We show that our scheme can reduce the information leakage by up to 60% compared to unplanned placement. Furthermore, our analysis on system attackability demonstrates that our scheme makes attacks on information more complex.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many complex systems can be modeled as temporal networks with time-evolving connections. The influence of their characteristics on epidemic spreading is analyzed in a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model illustrated by the discrete-time Markov chain approach. We develop the analytical epidemic thresholds in terms of the spectral radius of weighted adjacency matrix by averaging temporal networks, e.g., periodic, nonperiodic Markovian networks, and a special nonperiodic non-Markovian network (the link activation network) in time. We discuss the impacts of statistical characteristics, e.g., bursts and duration heterogeneity, as well as time-reversed characteristic on epidemic thresholds. We confirm the tightness of the proposed epidemic thresholds with numerical simulations on seven artificial and empirical temporal networks and show that the epidemic threshold of our theory is more precise than those of previous studies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, UAVs have received much attention in both the military and civilian fields for monitoring, emergency relief and searching tasks. UAVs are considered a new technology to obtain data at high altitudes when equipped with sensors. This technology is vital to the success of next-generation monitoring systems, which are expected to be reliable, real-time, efficient and secure. However, due to the bandwidth limitations in UAV-aided networks, the size of the transmitted data is a crucial factor for real-time media data transmission requirements, especially for national defense. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a real-time end-to-end media data transmission mechanism with an unsupervised deep neural network. The proposed mechanism transmutes the media data captured by UAVs into latent codes with a predefined constant size and transmits the codes to the ground console station (GCS) for further reconstruction. We use a real-word dataset containing millions of samples to evaluate the proposed mechanism which achieves a high transmission ratio, low resource usage and good visual quality.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Crowdsourced wireless community network enables the individual users to share their private Wi-Fi access points (APs) with each other, hence it can achieve a large Wi-Fi coverage with a small deployment cost via crowdsourcing. This paper presents a novel contract-based incentive framework to incentivize such a Wi-Fi network crowdsourcing under incomplete information (where each user has certain private information such as mobility pattern and Wi-Fi access quality). In the proposed framework, the network operator designs and offers a set of contract items to users, each consisting of a Wi-Fi access price (that a user can charge others for accessing his AP) and a subscription fee (that a user needs to pay the operator for joining the community). Different from the existing contracts in the literature, in our contract model, each user's best choice depends not only on his private information but also on other user's choices. This greatly complicates the contract design, as the operator needs to analyze the equilibrium choices of all users, rather than the best choice of each single user. We first derive the feasible contract that guarantees the user's truthful information disclosure based on the equilibrium analysis of the user choice, and then derive the optimal (and feasible) contract that yields a maximal profit for the operator. Our analysis shows that a user who provides a higher Wi-Fi access quality is more likely to choose a higher Wi-Fi access price and subscription fee, regardless of the user mobility pattern. Simulation results further show that when increasing the average Wi-Fi access quality of users, the operator can gain more profit, but (counter-intuitively) offer lower Wi-Fi access prices and subscription fees for users.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Current work emanates from the particularities residing in contemporary social media storytelling, where multiple users and publishing channels are involved for capturing and sharing public-events, experiences and places.Multi-channel presentation and visualization mechanisms are pursued along with novel audiovisual mixing (i.e. time-delay-compensation enhancement, perceptual mixing/quality-based content-selection, linking to context-aware meta-data, propagating multimedia semantics, etc.), promoting multimodal social media editing, processing and authoring. While the exploitation of multiple time-based media (audio-video) describing the same event may lead to significant content enhancement, difficulties regarding detection and temporal-synchronization of multimedia events have to be overcome. We argue that in many cases, one may identify events based only on audio features, thus performing an initial cost-effective annotation of the multimedia content. In this paper, we introduce a new audio-driven approach for temporal-alignment and management of shared audiovisual streams. We present the theoretical framework and demonstrate our methodology in real-world scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In image compression and transmission, two basic data redundancies can be identified and exploited: statistical redundancy and perceptual redundancy. Statistical redundancy has been studied for a very long time and has been exploited in most image coding schemes. However, perceptual redundancy has not yet been completely exploited. Furthermore, perceptual redundancy is difficult to exploit by using digital coding techniques because power allocation is performed at the bit level for digital coding. However, as one of one-size-fits-all technique, soft transmission is suitable to exploit the perceptual redundancy because its power allocation is directly applied at the pixel level instead of the bit level. In this paper, we propose a novel image transmission scheme, named FoveaCast, for Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) or Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) broadcast systems that effectively utilizes the foveation characteristic of human vision and analog coding techniques to achieve higher visual perceptual quality. Hence, our scheme possesses not only high visual perceptual quality but also graceful quality adaptation. Experimental evaluations show that compared with three existing digital schemes and two existing analog schemes, SoftCast and ParCast, FoveaCast achieves better visual perceptual performance. Meanwhile, it achieves a graceful quality variation along with channel variation, behaving just like SoftCast and ParCast.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vital nodes play a pivotal part of network structure and dynamics, where finding the minimal size of a set of vital nodes belongs to an NP-hard problem and cannot be solved by a polynomial algorithm. Recent studies of vital nodes identification mostly rely on the structural information, such as collective influence and degree. However, the performance of local-based methods varies for different structure while the complexities of global-based methods are generally high for most situations. Here, we map the problem into an optimization issue based on global information of network structure and propose a belief propagation and node reinsertion (BPR) method with almost linear time complexity, where finding the minimum feeding back vertex set is a key. Compared with several state-of-the-art heuristic methods, the BPR method has advantages of high accuracy and practicability of vital nodes identification and low computational complexity. Under two attack schemes: static and dynamical, extensive experiments of Erd&amp;#x0151;s&amp;#x2013;R&amp;#x00E9;nyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) models and real-world networks of the power grid and traffic network convincingly demonstrate that BPR method remarkably outperforms other methods in vital nodes identification. This helps to reassess the operational risk of a network and improve robustness ranging from network design schemes, protection strategies to failure mitigation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>For the wide variety of emerging data in our daily life, realizing exemplar-based clustering effectively and understanding its clustering behavior appropriately become more desirable. In this paper, based on a new look at the Bayesian framework of data clustering, two new concepts are introduced and they correspond to a Bayesian information transmission system and its transmission learning. Facilitated by the new concepts, an exemplar-based transmission learning machine for clustering (ETLMC) is accordingly developed. As an attempt to explain the exemplar-based clustering behavior in a physics-based manner, ETLMC is well justified by revealing that the exemplar masses transfer between data objects during the clustering process can be governed by the proposed gravity enrichment effect rooted at Newton's law of gravity. Practically, ETLMC is distinctive in its easy implementation in terms of its global analytical solution, its fast exemplar finding for large scale data with arbitrary shapes, its easy parameter settings and its stable and efficient clustering results. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ETLMC, in contrast to a number of existing state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With rapid development of computer vision and artificial intelligence, cities are becoming more and more intelligent. Recently, since intelligent surveillance was applied in all kind of smart city services, object tracking attracted more attention. However, two serious problems blocked development of visual tracking in real applications. The first problem is its lower performance under intense illumination variation while the second issue is its slow speed. This paper addressed these two problems by proposing a correlation filter based tracker. Fog computing platform was deployed to accelerate the proposed tracking approach. The tracker was constructed by multiple positions&amp;#x0027; detections and alternate templates (MPAT). The detection position was repositioned according to the estimated speed of target by optical flow method, and the alternate template was stored with a template update mechanism, which were all computed at the edge. Experimental results on large-scale public benchmark datasets showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Online action detection is a brand new challenge and plays a critical role in the visual surveillance analytics. It goes one step further over conventional action recognition task, which recognizes human actions from well-segmented clips. Online action detection is desired to identify the action type and localize action positions on the fly from the untrimmed stream data. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Modality Multi-Task Recurrent Neural Network (MM-MT RNN), which incorporates both RGB and Skeleton networks. We design different temporal modeling networks to capture specific characteristics from various modalities. Then, a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) subnetwork is utilized effectively to capture the complex longrange temporal dynamics, naturally avoiding the conventional sliding window design and thus ensuring high computational efficiency. Constrained by a multi-task objective function in the training phase, this network achieves superior detection performance and is capable of automatically localizing the start and end points of actions more accurately. Furthermore, embedding subtask of regression provides the ability to forecast the action prior to its occurrence. We evaluate the proposed method and several other methods in action detection and forecasting on the Online Action Detection Dataset (OAD) and Gaming Action Dataset (G3D) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both two tasks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Most recent learning-based single-image super-resolution methods first interpolate the low-resolution (LR) input, from which overlapped LR features are then extracted to reconstruct their high-resolution (HR) counterparts and the final HR image. However, most of them neglect to take advantage of the intermediate recovered HR image to enhance image quality further. We conduct principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce LR feature dimension. Then we find that the number of principal components after conducting PCA in the LR feature space from the reconstructed images is larger than that from the interpolated images by using bicubic interpolation. Based on this observation, we present an unsophisticated yet effective framework named collaborative representation cascade (CRC) that learns multilayer mapping models between LR and HR feature pairs. In particular, we extract the features from the intermediate recovered image to upscale and enhance LR input progressively. In the learning phase, for each cascade layer, we use the intermediate recovered results and their original HR counterparts to learn single-layer mapping model. Then, we use this single-layer mapping model to super-resolve the original LR inputs. And the intermediate HR outputs are regarded as training inputs for the next cascade layer, until we obtain multilayer mapping models. In the reconstruction phase, we extract multiple sets of LR features from the LR image and intermediate recovered. Then, in each cascade layer, mapping model is utilized to pursue HR image. Our experiments on several commonly used image SR testing datasets show that our proposed CRC method achieves state-of-the-art image SR results, and CRC can also be served as a general image enhancement framework.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>TV ratings are a widely used indicator in the TV broadcasting field. While TV ratings are mainly used in advertising, they can also be used as a social sensor that reflects the interests of people. This paper presents a framework for discovering audience behavior through the mining of TV ratings. We have established a framework that enables discovery of numerous patterns of audience behavior from TV ratings. Used along with other multimedia contents such as video and text, it enables various types of knowledge to be semi-automatically found, such as what types of news programs are of most interest and what are the key visual features for acquiring high TV ratings.The discovery of audience behavior is achieved by focusing on the change points in the rating data, i.e., the points in time where many people switch the channel or turn the television on or off. Rich descriptions that characterize these points are extracted from multimedia contents, and then various filtering techniques are used to extract specific patterns of interest. Several applications of this framework for discovering knowledge demonstrated that it can effectively extract various types of audience behavior.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Hierarchical structures include spatial systems (e.g. a continent), clusters of a spatial system (e.g. countries of a continent), zones of a cluster (e.g. states of a country), and so on. Variable-specific classification of the zones &amp;#61480; &amp;#61481; i X of a cluster of zones &amp;#61480; X &amp;#61481; within a spatial system is the main focus of this paper. Variable-specific (e.g. GDP, population, trade, resources, economic activity etc) classification of zones is done by computing the levels of interaction between the ith and jth zones. Based on a heuristic argument, we proposed a modified gravity model for the computation of levels of interaction between the zones. This argument is based on the following two facts: (i) the level of interaction between the zones i X and j X , with masses i mX and j mX is direction-dependent, and (ii) the level of interactions between the zones i X and j X , with masses i mX and j mX , situated at strategically insignificant locations would be much different (lesser) from that of the zones i X and j X with similar masses i mX and j mX but situated at strategically highly significant locations. Based on this argument, we provide a modified gravity model by incorporating the ij ji dX &amp;#61625; dX , and the product of location significance indexes &amp;#61480; &amp;#61481; i j &amp;#61546; X&amp;#61546; X of the corresponding zones. This modified gravity model yields the level of interaction between the two zones that satisfies ij ji FX &amp;#61625; FX . We demonstrate this modified gravity model on the 28 states of India, whereby the areal extents (land resources) of each state is considered as a parameter mass. The levels of interactions are presented for all pairs of states.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The Mobile Edge Network (MEN) has emerged as the basic infrastructure to support fifth-generation networks, mobile edge computing and fog computing. The characteristics of mobility must be addressed to guarantee the quality of service in MENs. As one of the critical problems in MENs, flexible deployment plays a part in exploiting edge networks. Despite the abundance of recently proposed strategies, most concentrate on the change in user demands and inevitably ignore the influence for the user mobility, which is common in future networks. We propose Provision for Mobile Edge Computing (PMEC), a prototype that takes advantage of storage devices with flexible placement. In PMEC, we accommodate various considerations and select different storage devices to cache, deploying the cache with the relationship of a two-tiered structure in the MEN. Thus, we construct a flexible overlay network with the objective of minimizing the cost in a two-tiered edge network. Based on the analysis of the problem, we solve the two-tiered placement from bottom to top using the dynamic minimal spanning tree (MST) algorithm and design two algorithms for each tier including the basic algorithm and the improved algorithms. The simulation is conducted on realistic data to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The surge in global population is compelling a shift towards smart agriculture practices. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources, limited availability of arable land, increase in unpredictable weather conditions makes food security a major concern for most countries. As a result, the use of internet of things (IoT) and data analytics (DA) are employed to enhance the operational efficiency and productivity in the agriculture sector. There is a paradigm shift from use of wireless sensors network (WSN) as a major driver of smart agriculture to the use of IoT and DA. The IoT integrates several existing technologies such as WSN, radio frequency identification, cloud computing, middleware systems and end-user applications. In this paper, several benefits and challenges of IoT have been identified. We present the IoT ecosystem and how the combination of IoT and DA is enabling smart agriculture. Furthermore, we provide future trends and opportunities which are categorized into technological innovations, application scenarios, business and marketability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The massive collection of data via emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) requires finding optimal ways to reduce the observations in the time series analysis domain. The IoT time series require aggregation methods that can preserve and represent the key characteristics of the data. In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm that adapts to unannounced mutations of the data (i.e. data drifts). The algorithm splits the data streams into blocks and groups them in square matrices, computes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and quantizes them. The key information is contained in the upper-left part of the resulting matrix. We extract this sub-matrix, compute the modulus of its eigenvalues and remove duplicates. The algorithm, called BEATS, is designed to tackle dynamic IoT streams, whose distribution changes over time. We implement experiments with six datasets combining real, synthetic, real-world data, and data with drifts. Compared to other segmentation methods like Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), BEATS shows significant improvements. Trying it with classification and clustering algorithms it provides efficient results. BEATS is an effective mechanism to work with dynamic and multi-variate data, making it suitable for IoT data sources. The datasets, code of the algorithm and the analysis results can be accessed publicly at: https://github.com/auroragonzalez/BEATS.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this era of big data, as relational databases are inefficient, NoSQL databases are a workable solution for data storage. In this context, one of the key issues is the veracity and therefore the data quality. Indeed, as with classic data, geospatial big data are generally fuzzy even though they are stored as crisp data (perfect data). Hence, if data are geospatial and fuzzy, additional complexities appear because of the complex syntax and semantic features of such data. The NoSQL databases do not offer strict data consistency. Therefore, new challenges are needed to be overcome to develop efficient methods that simultaneously ensure the performance and the consistency in storing fuzzy geospatial big data. This paper presents a new methodology that tackles the storage issues and validates the fuzzy spatial entities' consistency in a document-based NoSQL system. Consequently, first, to better express the structure of fuzzy geospatial data in such a system, we present a logical model called Fuzzy GeoJSON schema. Second, for consistent storage, we implement a schema-driven pipeline based on the Fuzzy GeoJSON schema and semantic constraints.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Modern theories on early child language acquisition tend to focus on referential words, mostly nouns, labeling concrete objects or physical properties. In this experimental proof-of-concept study we show how non-referential negation words, typically belonging to a child&amp;#x2019;s first ten words, may be acquired. A child-like humanoid robot is deployed in speech-wise unconstrained interaction with na&amp;#x00EF;ve human participants. In agreement with psycholinguistic observations we corroborate the hypothesis that affect plays a pivotal role in the socially distributed acquisition process where the adept conversation partner provides linguistic interpretations of the affective displays of the less adept speaker. Negation words are prosodically salient within intent interpretations that are triggered by the learner&amp;#x2019;s display of affect. From there they can be picked up and used by the budding language learner which may involve the grounding of these words in the very affective states that triggered them in the first place. The pragmatic analysis of the robot&amp;#x2019;s linguistic performance indicates that the correct timing of negative utterances is essential for the listener to infer the meaning of otherwise ambiguous negative utterances. In order to assess the robot&amp;#x2019;s performance thoroughly comparative data from psycholinguistic studies of parent-child dyads is needed highlighting the need for further interdisciplinary work.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The importance of affective states in learning has led many Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to include students&amp;#x0027; affective states in their learner models. The adaptation and hence the benefits of an ITS can be improved by detecting and responding to students&amp;#x0027; affective states. In prior work, we have created and validated a theory-driven model for detecting students&amp;#x0027; frustration, as well as identifying its causes as students interact with the ITS. In this paper, we present a strategy to respond to students&amp;#x0027; frustration by offering motivational messages that address different causes of frustration. Based on attribution theory, these messages are created to praise the student&amp;#x0027;s effort, attribute the results to the identified cause, show sympathy for failure or obtain feedback from the students. We implemented our approach in three schools where students interacted with the ITS. Data from 188 students from the three schools collected across two weeks was used for our analysis. The results suggest that the frustration instances reduced significantly statistically (p &amp;lt; 0.05), due to the motivational messages. This study suggests that motivational messages that use attribution theory and address the reason for frustration reduce the number frustration instances per session.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that impairs the development of social and communication skills. There is evidence that children with ASD prefer images of self over others [1]. These studies may explain the effectiveness of video self-modeling (VSM), an evidence-based ASD intervention in which one learns by watching oneself on video performing a target behavior. VSM content is difficult to create as target behaviors are sporadic. In this paper, we propose the MEBook system which uses a Kinect sensor to inject self-images into a gesture-based social narrative to teach children with ASD proper greeting behaviors. MEBook consists of two components. The first component is a social narrative. A social narrative is an animated story about the main character meeting and greeting different cartoon characters in a particular setting. Self-modeling is achieved by first replacing the main characters face with an image of the learner, and then animating the learners body and voice to match the narration. The second component is a positive reinforcement practice session in which the subject is prompted to greet different cartoon characters. Through depth-based body posture tracking, proper greeting behaviors are recognized and immediately reinforced with praise and visual confetti. Novel computational multimedia tools are proposed to turn video recordings of successful attempts into VSM content, thereby alleviating the tedious production process. A multiple-baseline single subject pilot study has been conducted and the preliminary results show that MEBook is potentially effective in teaching greeting behaviors to children with ASD</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile social networks (MSNs) enable users to discover and share contents with each other, especially at ephemeral events such as exhibitions and conferences where users could be strangers. Nevertheless, the incentive of users to actively share their contents in MSNs may be lacking if the corresponding cost is high. Besides, as users in MSN share contents in an impromptu way as they move, it makes them vulnerable to malicious users who may want to disseminate false contents. This is because users may not have knowledge about the peers they are socially connecting with in the network. In this paper, we propose MCoST, a mechanism that motivates content sharing in MSN and ensures that only trustworthy contents are shared. The mechanism is built on users&amp;#x2019; collective bidding, content cost sharing and trust evaluation while guaranteeing individual rationality. MCoST enables content providers to share contents with multiple users simultaneously by utilizing the broadcast nature of wireless transmission. The cost of the content is collectively compensated by the content receivers through the content bidding mechanism in MCoST. In ensuring that users can establish the trustworthiness of their encounters&amp;#x2019; contents, MCoST incorporates a robust trust evaluation framework that guarantees that content reviews are immutable and tamper-proof, resistive to sybil and rejection attacks, and that users cannot have multiple and fake identities in the network or reject negative reviews about their contents. This is achieved by integrating a distributed cryptographic hash-chained content review mechanism in the design of MCoST. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed mechanism efficiently evaluates contents&amp;#x2019; trustworthiness by detecting and discriminating review-chains under sybil or rejection attacks and reduces the time and cost to collect the desired contents by 86&amp;#x0025; and 40&amp;#x0025; respective- y, and improves network utilization by 50&amp;#x0025;.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>After decades of digitization, large cultural heritage collections have emerged on the web, which contain massive stocks of content from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. This increase in digital cultural heritage data promises new modes of analysis and increased levels of access for academic scholars and casual users alike. Going beyond the standard representations of search-centric and grid-based interfaces, a multitude of approaches has recently started to enable visual access to cultural collections, and to explore them as complex and comprehensive information spaces by the means of interactive visualizations. In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector. This new class of information visualizations gives rise to a notable diversity of interaction and representation techniques while lending currency and urgency to a discussion about principles such as serendipity, generosity, and criticality in connection with visualization design. With this survey, we review information visualization approaches to digital cultural heritage collections and reflect on the state of the art in techniques and design choices. We contextualize our survey with humanist perspectives on the field and point out opportunities for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we investigate the power allocation in a multi-user wireless system to maximize the Energy efficiency (EE), while meeting the power constrains of each individual user as well as the whole system. Specifically, a geometric ceiled-waterfilling algorithm is proposed to solve this non-linear fractional optimization problem, which can compute exact solutions with a low degree of polynomial computational complexity. Optimality of the proposed algorithm is strictly proved with mathematic analysis. In addition, the proposed algorithm is further extended to the general case with the minimum system-level throughput constraint, considering the quality of service (QoS) requirement. To the best of our knowledge, no prior algorithm in the open literature offered such optimal solutions to the target problems, with the merit of exactness and the efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed power allocation algorithms can improve the energy efficiency by nearly 50&amp;#x0025;, compared with the conventional Dinkelbach&amp;#x2019;s method with the same amount of computations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Even well-designed software systems suffer from chronic performance degradation, also known as &amp;#x201C;software aging&amp;#x201D;, due to internal (e.g., software bugs) or external (e.g., resource exhaustion) impairments. These chronic problems often fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe impacts (e.g., system failures). Therefore, it is a challenging issue how to timely predict the occurrence of failures caused by these problems. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of prior approaches are far from satisfactory due to the insufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. To accurately predict failures caused by software aging which are named as Aging-Related Failure (ARFs), this paper presents a novel entropy-based aging indicator, namely Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy (MMSE) which leverages the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to indicate software aging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to leverage entropy to predict ARFs. Based upon MMSE, we implement three failure prediction approaches encapsulated in a proof-of-concept prototype named ARF-Predictor. The experimental evaluations in a Video on Demand (VoD) system, and in a real-world production system, AntVision, show that ARF-Predictor can predict ARFs with a very high accuracy and a low Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF). Compared to previous approaches, ARF-Predictor improves the prediction accuracy by about 5 times and reduces ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude. In addition, ARF-Predictor is light-weight enough to satisfy the real-time requirement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we aim at developing a new collaborative filtering recommender system using soft ratings, which is capable of dealing with both imperfect information about user preferences and the sparsity problem. On the one hand, Dempster-Shafer theory is employed for handling the imperfect information due to its advantage in providing not only a flexible framework for modeling uncertain, imprecise, and incomplete information, but also powerful operations for fusion of information from multiple sources. On the other hand, in dealing with the sparsity problem, community context information that is extracted from the social network containing all users is used for predicting unprovided ratings. As predicted ratings are not a hundred percent accurate, while the provided ratings are actually evaluated by users, we also develop a new method for calculating user-user similarities, in which provided ratings are considered to be more significant than predicted ones. In the experiments, the developed recommender system is tested on two different data sets; and the experiment results indicate that this system is more effective than CoFiDS, a typical recommender system offering soft ratings.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Use of social network is the basic functionality of today&amp;#x0027;s life. Anomalies are the major cause of online frauds which allow information access by unauthorized users as well as information forging. One of the anomalies that act as a silent attacker is the horizontal anomaly. These are the anomalies caused by a user because of his/her variable behaviour towards different sources. Horizontal anomalies are difficult to detect and hazardous for any network. In this paper, a self-healing neuro-fuzzy approach (NHAD) is used for the detection, recovery, and removal of horizontal anomalies efficiently and accurately. The proposed approach operates over the five paradigms, namely, missing links, reputation gain, significant difference, trust properties, and trust score. The proposed approach is evaluated with three datasets: DARPA&amp;#x0027;98 benchmark dataset, synthetic dataset, and real-time traffic. Results show that the accuracy of the proposed NHAD model for 10% to 30% anomalies in synthetic dataset ranges between 98.08% and 99.88%. The evaluation over DARPA&amp;#x0027;98 dataset demonstrates that the proposed approach is better than the existing solutions as it provides 99.97% detection rate for anomalous class. For real-time traffic, the proposed NHAD model operates with an average accuracy of 99.42% at 99.90% detection rate</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Anomaly detection for cloud servers is important for detecting zero-day attacks. However, it is very challenging due to the large amount of accumulated data. In this paper, a new mathematical model for modeling dynamic usage behavior and detecting anomalies is proposed. It is constructed using state summarization and a novel nested-arc hidden semi-Markov model (NAHSMM). State summarization is designed to extract usage behavior reflective states from a raw sequence. The NAHSMM is comprised of exterior and interior hidden Markov chains. The exterior controls the propagation of raw sequences of system calls and, conditional on it, the interior one controls the summarized observation process from the transition less usage behavior reflective states. An anomaly detection algorithm is derived by integrating state summarization and NAHSMM. During training the algorithm is assisted by a forensic module to tune the behavioral threshold. Experimental data is collected using IXIA Perfect Storm in conjunction with the commercial security-test hardware platform cyber range. To evaluate the reliability of the proposed model, firstly, its accuracy and training costs are compared with those of existing machine-learning models and then its scalability and resistance capabilities are tested. The results indicate that this model could be used as a method for detecting anomalies in cloud servers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Blind quality assessment of screen content images (SCIs) is much challenging than traditional natural images. In this paper, we propose a blind quality predictor for SCIs to explore the issue from the perspective of sparse representation. Specifically, we conduct local sparse representation for the textual and pictorial regions, respectively, and conduct global sparse representation for the global SCIs. Subsequently, the underlying relationship between the feature and quality vectors is bridged in a universal sparse representation framework. The quality pooling is comparatively simply that only need to estimate the local and global quality scores and combine them to a total one. Our experimental results show that the proposed predictor can achieve better prediction performance to be in line with subjective assessment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), as an integration of satellite systems, aerial networks and terrestrial communications, has been becoming an emerging architecture and attracted intensive research interest during the past years. Besides bringing significant benefits for various practical services and applications, SAGIN is also facing many unprecedented challenges due to its specific characteristics such as heterogeneity, self-organization, and time-variability. Compared to traditional ground or satellite networks, SAGIN is affected by the limited and unbalanced network resources in all three network segments, so that it is difficult to obtain the best performances for traffic delivery. Therefore, the system integration, protocol optimization, resource management and allocation in SAGIN is of great significance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present the state-of-the-art of the SAGIN since existing survey papers focused on either only one single network segment in space or air, or the integration of space-ground, neglecting the integration of all the three network segments. In light of this, we present in this paper a comprehensive review of recent research works concerning SAGIN from network design and resource allocation to performance analysis and optimization. After discussing several existing network architectures, we also point out some technology challenges and future directions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Data mapping plays an important role in data integration and exchanges among institutions and organizations with different data standards. However, traditional rule-based approaches and machine learning methods fail to achieve satisfactory results for the data mapping problem. In this paper, we propose a novel and sophisticated deep learning framework for data mapping called mixture feature embedding convolutional neural network (MfeCNN). The MfeCNN model converts the data mapping task to a multiple classification problem. In the model, we incorporated multimodal learning and multiview embedding into a CNN for mixture feature tensor generation and classification prediction. Multimodal features were extracted from various linguistic spaces with a medical natural language processing package. Then, powerful feature embeddings were learned by using the CNN. As many as 10 classes could be simultaneously classified by a softmax prediction layer based on multiview embedding. MfeCNN achieved the best results on unbalanced data (average F1 score, 82.4&amp;#x0025;) among traditional state-of-the-art machine learning models and CNN without mixture feature embedding. Our model also outperformed a very deep CNN with 29 layers, which took free texts as inputs. The combination of mixture feature embedding and a deep neural network can achieve high accuracy for data mapping and multiple classification.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, the management of delay-sensitive medical packet transmissions in beyond wireless body area networks (beyond-WBANs) is studied. The considered system addresses the random arrival of sensed medical packets at each WBAN-gateway, which are categorized into different classes (one class of emergent alarms and multiple classes of non-emergent routines). Upon receiving a medical packet, the associated gateway immediately declares a beyond-WBAN transmission request to the base station (BS). With the consideration of medical-grade quality of service (mQoS) requirements, the beyond-WBAN transmissions of heterogeneous packets are scheduled by following the constructed queueing models with specifically designed priority disciplines. By further considering the potential strategic behaviors of smart gateways, a non-cooperative delay-dependent prioritized queueing game for the beyond-WBAN transmission management is formulated. After that, we propose a novel analytical framework to jointly characterize the queueing performance and the properties of the game equilibrium. Theoretical and simulation results justify the feasibility and applicability of our designed transmission management system in beyond-WBANs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The classical rough set theory was presented by Pawlak, which is mainly concerned with the approximation of sets described by a single binary relation on the universe. In the present paper, we initiate a multi attribute group decision making problems in the presence of multi attribute and multi decision in decision making with preferences. Then resolving the problem, using two different approximation strategies, i.e., seeking common reserving difference and seeking common rejecting difference, four kinds of soft dominance based multi-granulation rough sets are presented, namely, soft dominance based optimistic multi-granulation rough sets and soft dominance based pessimistic multi-granulation rough sets and their applications in solving a multi agent conflict analysis decision problem. The proposed method addresses the limitations of the Pawlak model and Sun&amp;#x2019;s conflict analysis model and thus improve these models. Finally, the results on labor management negotiation problems show that the proposed algorithms are more effective and effcient for feasible consensus strategy when compared with Sun&amp;#x2019;s technique.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Time series processing and analyzing is one of the major challenges in big data research, especially in inferring the dynamical mechanism of time series. In this paper, we constructed a complex network from time series via exploring the evolutionary relationship among the volatility patterns. We introduced the symbolic method and sliding window to describe volatility patterns of time series that contains multidimensional information. Meanwhile, we explored the evolutionary mechanism of these volatility patterns based on the topological characteristics in network. In our research, we selected six stock indices around the world as sample data. Interestingly, for the six networks, they all showed a &amp;#x2018;petal-shaped&amp;#x2019; structure which consists of a core and loops. Moreover, through analyzing the topological characteristics of the six networks, we discovered distinguished results of their overall characteristics and loop length distributions. Furthermore, we uncovered the media patterns which trigger the structure of network changing among core and loops. In a word, our work described the volatility patterns and explored the topological characteristics in networks constructed from time series data, which provides a novel perspective to understand the evolutionary dynamic mechanism.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>People use various online social networks for different purposes. The user information on each social network is usually partial. Thus, matching the users across these multiple online social networks is of great significance for providing new services as well as new insights on user behaviors. Recent research shows that group structure widely exists on social networks, in which members work together with certain purpose and are more influential than individuals on online social networks. Previous works provide outstanding solutions for mapping individuals, but few ones pay attention to the study of groups across multiple social networks. To address the research gap, we first aim to propose an effective method to detect similar group across multiple social networks. The method mainly has three steps, including detecting group structure based on random walks, extracting similarity features, and inferring group similarity using probabilistic graphical model. We evaluate our algorithm on five different types of online social networks. Experimental results show that our method achieves 0.693, 0.779, 0.729 in precision, recall, and F1-measure, which significantly surpass the state-of-the-art by 31.4&amp;#x0025;-44.3&amp;#x0025;, 17.3&amp;#x0025;-26.3&amp;#x0025;, and 25.9&amp;#x0025;-31.6&amp;#x0025;, respectively. The outstanding performance of our method demonstrates that our proposal can reach the requirement of detecting similar groups across social networks. In particular, the result of this paper paves the way for the recommendation system, link prediction and information diffusion across sites.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cyber physical systems (CPS) is a tightly coupled integration and interaction between computational and physical components. In many cases, information collection in CPS is provided through a group of distributed sensors and all of them change continuously with time. Thus the sensor information is usually in the form of time series. One particularly interesting application in time series analysis is use of complex networks to represent and study behaviors of system. Complex networks has been playing an important role for analyzing complex systems as it helps understanding the topology structure of systems with different interacting units. In this paper, we proposed a reliable method for constructing complex networks from multivariate time series (MTSs) in the cases of single and multisensor based on information geometry theory, which allows the information in the time series to be extracted by analyzing the associated complex network. We first estimate covariance matrices and then a geodesic-based distance between the covariance matrices is introduced. Consequently, the network can be constructed on a Riemannian manifold where the nodes and edges correspond to the covariance matrix and the geodesic-based distance, respectively. The proposed method provides us with a nonlinear relationship and intrinsic geometry viewpoint to understand the MTSs and also an alternative approach to fuse, model, represent, and visualize the multisensor data in CPS. A number of experimental studies and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the generality and the effectiveness of our approach with both synthetic and real datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In learning applications, exploring the cluster structures of the high dimensional data is an important task. It requires projecting or visualizing the cluster structures into a low dimensional space. The challenges are: 1) how to perform the projection or visualization with less information loss and 2) how to preserve the interpretability of the original data. Recent methods address these challenges simultaneously by unsupervised feature selection. They learn the cluster indicators based on the k nearest neighbor similarity graph, then select the features highly correlated with these indicators. Under this direction, many techniques, such as local discriminative analysis, nonnegative spectral analysis, nonnegative matrix factorization, etc., have been successfully introduced to make the selection more accurate. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the unsupervised feature selection in another perspective, namely, making the selection exploit the combination effect of the features. Given the expected feature amount, previous works operate on the whole features then select those of high coefficients one by one as the output. Our proposed method, instead, operates on a group of features initially then update the selection when a better group appears. Compared to the previous methods, the proposed method exploits the combination effect of the features by &amp;#x2113;2,0 norm. It improves the selection accuracy where the cluster structures are strongly related to a group of features. We conduct the experiments on six open access data sets from different domains. The experimental results show that our proposed method is more accurate than the recent methods which do not specially consider the combination effect of the features.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, the possibility of quantifying a person&amp;#x2019;s interest using data driven algorithms is investigated. Intuitively speaking, there is a feeling that when a person engages with an object, e.g. Text Messaging Apps, Mobile Games, Outdoor Sports, Social Networking Websites, etc., there is some, it does not matter how small, interest in the object. However, there is a lack of a procedure that could estimate up to what degree is the user interested. In lay terms, can one quantify, and thus, find a &amp;#x201C;number&amp;#x201D; for interest? This question is addressed in this paper. In doing so, interest estimation problem is formulated as a latent state estimation problem, and an answer is deduced via Bayesian Inference. First, a Subjective- Objective approach is used to measure activity. Through this calculated activity, the method indirectly infers human latent state values. A formulation of interest is then presented by drawing inspiration from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process in Physics. Moreover, concepts of stochastic volatility are employed to vary the instantaneous volatility of the OU process. This is done to further improve the performance. Second, the convergence speed of the OU process is also varied with time. A novel statistical framework is discussed that dynamically transforms interest into activity. Ideas from adaptive filtering are borrowed to formulate this functional map. Each of these individual contributions is combined to present a solution via Monte Carlo Simulations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, numerical simulations are performed on real datasets. Lastly, a prototype is engineered and the method is implemented as a RESTful Web service. The prototype is hosted as a Web service on several Virtual Machines to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the framework in cloud based deployment scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Identity-based encryption (IBE) is a public key cryptosystem and eliminates the demands of public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate administration in conventional public key settings. Due to the absence of PKI, the revocation problem is a critical issue in IBE settings. Several revocable IBE schemes have been proposed regarding this issue. Quite recently, by embedding an outsourcing computation technique into IBE, Li et al. proposed a revocable IBE scheme with a key-update cloud service provider (KU-CSP). However, their scheme has two shortcomings. One is that the computation and communication costs are higher than previous revocable IBE schemes. The other shortcoming is lack of scalability in the sense that the KU-CSP must keep a secret value for each user. In the article, we propose a new revocable IBE scheme with a cloud revocation authority (CRA) to solve the two shortcomings, namely, the performance is significantly improved and the CRA holds only a system secret for all the users. For security analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is semantically secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. Finally, we extend the proposed revocable IBE scheme to present a CRA-aided authentication scheme with period-limited privileges for managing a large number of various cloud services.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The Internet of Things&amp;#x2019; (IoT&amp;#x2019;s) rapid growth is constrained by resource use and fears about privacy and security. A solution jointly addressing security, efficiency, privacy, and scalability is needed to support continued expansion. We propose a solution modeled on human use of context and cognition, leveraging cloud resources to facilitate IoT on constrained devices. We present an architecture applying process knowledge to provide security through abstraction and privacy through remote data fusion. We outline five architectural elements and consider the key concepts of the &amp;#x201C;Data Proxy&amp;#x201D; and the &amp;#x201C;Cognitive Layer.&amp;#x201D; The Data Proxy uses system models to digitally mirror objects with minimal input data, while the Cognitive Layer applies these models to monitor the system&amp;#x2019;s evolution and to simulate the impact of commands prior to execution. The Data Proxy allows a system&amp;#x2019;s sensors to be sampled to meet a specified &amp;#x201C;Quality of Data&amp;#x201D; (QoD) target with minimal resource use. The efficiency improvement of this architecture is shown with an example vehicle tracking application. Finally, we consider future opportunities for this architecture to reduce technical, economic, and sentiment barriers to the adoption of the IoT.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>While High Performance Computing (HPC) centers continuously evolve to provide more computing power to their users, we observe a wish for the convergence between Cloud Computing (CC) and HPC platforms, with the commercial hope to see CC infrastructures to eventually replace in-house facilities. If we exclude the performance point of view where many previous studies highlight a non-negligible overhead induced by the virtualization layer at the heart of every Cloud middleware when running a HPC workload, the question of the real costeffectiveness is often left aside with the intuition that, most probably, the instances offered by the Cloud providers are competitive from a cost point of view. In this article, we wanted to assert (or infirm) this intuition by analyzing what composes the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of an in-house HPC facility operated internally since 2007. This TCO model is then used to compare with the induced cost that would have been required to run the same platform (and the same workload) over a competitive Cloud IaaS offer. Our approach to address this price comparison is three-fold. First we propose a theoretical price - performance model based on the study of the actual Cloud instances proposed by one of the major Cloud IaaS actors: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Then, based on the HPC facility TCO analysis we propose a hourly price comparison between our in-house cluster and the equivalent EC2 instances. Finally, based on the experimental benchmarking on the local cluster and on the Cloud instances we propose an update of the former theoretical price model to reflect the real system performance. The results obtained advocate in general for the acquisition of an in-house HPC facility, which balances the common intuition in favor of Cloud Computing (CC) platforms, would they be provided by the reference Cloud provider worldwide.</dcterms:abstract>

We analyse the data from a player engagement perspective, how the business model affects players, how players influence the business model and provide strategic insights for players themselves. Sifa et al. myNotes{found} a lack of cross-game analytics while Marchand and Hennig-Thurau identified a lack of understanding of how a game's business model and strategies affect players. We address both issues. The three games have similar business models but differ in one aspect: the distribution model for the cards used in the game. Our longitudinal analysis highlights this variation's impact. A uniform distribution creates a spread of decks with slowly emerging trends while a random distribution creates stripes of deck building activity that switch suddenly each update. Our method is simple, easily understandable, independent of the specific game's structure and able to compare multiple games. It myNotes{is applicable to games} that release updates and enables comparison across games. Optimising a game's updates strategy is key as it affects player engagement and retention which directly influence businesses' revenues and profitability in the &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${$}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;95 billion global games market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A Series-Series compensated capacitors topology of the wireless power transmission (WPT) system has characteristics of increasing active power at coil misalignment when controlled using the conventional secondary DC-link voltage control. This results in larger total capacity of the primary and secondary sides' converters. To cope with these problems, this paper proposes a simple constant secondary active power control method, where the secondary DC-link voltage is regulated according to the onboard active power rating and secondary current. The effectiveness of the control method is verified by 100 W experimental systems. The numerical simulation that considers the harmonic components is developed to be compared and justified by the experimental results, which is then used to design the capacity of 300 kW WPT system assuming actual railway vehicle application. By the proposed method, the design criteria of the rating voltage and current of the primary and secondary side components can be determined.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The Parallel Coordinates plot is a popular tool for the visualization of high-dimensional data. One of the main challenges when using parallel coordinates is occlusion and overplotting resulting from large data sets. Brushing is a popular approach to address these challenges. Since its conception, limited improvements have been made to brushing both in the form of visual design and functional interaction. We present a set of novel, smart brushing techniques that enhance the standard interactive brushing of a parallel coordinates plot. We introduce two new interaction concepts: Higher-order, sketch-based brushing, and smart, data-driven brushing. Higher-order brushes support interactive, flexible, n-dimensional pattern searches involving an arbitrary number of dimensions. Smart, data-driven brushing provides interactive, real-time guidance to the user during the brushing process based on derived meta-data. In addition, we implement a selection of novel enhancements and user options that complement the two techniques as well as enhance the exploration and analytical ability of the user. We demonstrate the utility and evaluate the results using a case study with a large, high-dimensional, real-world telecommunication data set and we report domain expert feedback from the data suppliers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social context plays an important role in everyday emotional interactions, and others&amp;#x0027; faces often provide contextual cues in social situations. Investigating this complex social process is a challenge that can be addressed with the use of computer-generated facial expressions. In the current research, we use synthesized facial expressions to investigate the influence of socioaffective inferential mechanisms on the recognition of social emotions. Participants judged blends of facial expressions of shame-sadness, or of anger-disgust, in a target avatar face presented at the center of a screen while a contextual avatar face expressed an emotion (disgust, contempt, sadness) or remained neutral. The dynamics of the facial expressions and the head/gaze movements of the two avatars were manipulated in order to create an interaction in which the two avatars shared eye gaze only in the social interaction condition. Results of Experiment 1 revealed that when the avatars engaged in social interaction, target expression blends of shame and sadness were perceived as expressing more shame if the contextual face expressed disgust and more sadness when the contextual face expressed sadness. Interestingly, perceptions of shame were not enhanced when the contextual face expressed contempt. The latter finding is probably attributable to the low recognition rates for the expression of contempt observed in Experiment 2.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Personalized recommendation is crucial to help users find pertinent information. It often relies on a large collection of user data, in particular users&amp;#x0027; online activity (e.g., tagging/rating/checking-in) on social media, to mine user preference. However, releasing such user activity data makes users vulnerable to inference attacks, as private data (e.g., gender) can often be inferred from the users&amp;#x0027; activity data. In this paper, we proposed PrivRank, a customizable and continuous privacy-preserving social media data publishing framework protecting users against inference attacks while enabling personalized ranking-based recommendations. Its key idea is to continuously obfuscate user activity data such that the privacy leakage of user-specified private data is minimized under a given data distortion budget, which bounds the ranking loss incurred from the data obfuscation process in order to preserve the utility of the data for enabling recommendations. An empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our framework can efficiently provide effective and continuous protection of user-specified private data, while still preserving the utility of the obfuscated data for personalized ranking-based recommendation. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, PrivRank achieves both a better privacy protection and a higher utility in all the ranking-based recommendation use cases we tested.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The ability to rank images based on their appearance finds many real-world applications such as image retrieval or image album creation. Despite the recent dominance of deep learning methods in computer vision which often result in superior performance, they are not always the methods of choice because they lack interpretability. In this work, we investigate the possibility of improving image aesthetic inference of convolutional neural networks with hand-designed features that rely on domain expertise in various fields. We perform a comparison of hand-crafted feature sets in their ability to predict fine-grained aesthetics scores on two image aesthetics datasets. We observe that even feature sets published earlier are able to compete with more recently published algorithms and, by combining the algorithms together, one can obtain a significant improvement in predicting image aesthetics. By using a tree-based learner, we perform feature elimination to understand the best performing features overall and across different image categories. Only roughly 15 % and 8 % of the features are needed to achieve full performance in predicting a fine-grained aesthetic score and binary classification respectively. By combining hand-crafted features with meta-features that predict the quality of an image based on CNN features, the model performs better than a baseline VGG16 model. One can, however, achieve more significant improvement in both aesthetics score prediction and binary classification by fusing the hand-crafted features and the penultimate layer activations. Our experiments indicate an improvement up to 2.2 % achieving current state-of-the-art binary classification accuracy on the AVA dataset when the hand-designed features are fused with activation from VGG16 and ResNet50 networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In order to innovatively solve cold-start problems, research involving trust and socially aware recommender systems is currently proliferating. The relative importance of academic conferences has led to the necessity of recommender systems that seek to generate recommendations for conference attendees. In this paper, we aim to improve the recommendation accuracy of socially-aware recommender systems by proposing a linear hybrid recommender algorithm called Personality and Socially-Aware Recommender (PerSAR). PerSAR hybridizes the social and personality behaviours of smart conference attendees. Our recommendation methodology mainly aims to employ an algorithmic framework that computes the personality similarities and tie strengths of conference attendees so that recommendations can be generated for them using a relevant dataset. The experimental results substantiate that our proposed recommendation method is favorable and outperforms other related and contemporary recommendation methods and techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Service composition remains an important topic where recommendation is widely recognized as a core mechanism. Existing works on service recommendation typically examine either association rules from mashup-service usage records, or latent topics from service descriptions. This paper moves one step further, by studying latent topic models over service collaboration history. A concept of service co-occurrence topic is coined, equipped with a mechanism developed to construct service co-occurrence documents. The key idea is to treat each service as a document and its co-occurring services as the bag of words in that document. Four gauges are constructed to measure self-co-occurrence of a specific service. A theoretical approach, Service Co-occurrence LDA (SeCo-LDA), is developed to extract latent service co-occurrence topics, including representative services and words, temporal strength, and services&amp;#x0027; impact on topics. Such derived knowledge of topics will help to reveal the trend of service composition, understand collaboration behaviors among services and lead to better service recommendation. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, experiments on a real-world data set were conducted. Compared with methods of Apriori, content matching based on service description, and LDA using mashup-service usage records, our experiments show that SeCo-LDA can recommend service composition more effectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the goal of incorporating the use of social network tools into the formal curriculum of public schools in Chile, Kelluwen developed a b-learning approach in which students work in groups and engage in peer review dynamics. To support such activities, the Kelluwen platform provides a complementary micro-blogging tool called Worklog. In this study we analyze data collected from Worklog messages generated by 101 cohorts of students from different schools and different levels, who participated in Kelluwen activities. We first used machine learning techniques to discover 3 types of message which coincide with three dialogic functions; referential, phatic, and emotional. We then analyze how different factors of the cohort and group setup relate to the presence of different dialogic functions in Worklog. Results show the positive effect of pairing groups of students from different schools, and the positive influence of teacher participation. Our work contributes to the discussion on the role of technological social tools on the implementation of complex b-learning activities in schools, as well as demonstrating how automatic and semi-automatic data analysis techniques can be used to better understand such complex interventions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Clustering large volumes of high-dimensional data is a challenging task. Many clustering algorithms have been developed to address either handling datasets with a very large sample size or with a very high number of dimensions, but they are often impractical when the data is large in both aspects. To simultaneously overcome both the &amp;#x2018;curse of dimensionality&amp;#x2019; problem due to high dimensions and scalability problems due to large sample size, we propose a new fast clustering algorithm called FensiVAT. FensiVAT is a hybrid, ensemble-based clustering algorithm which uses fast data-space reduction and an intelligent sampling strategy. In addition to clustering, FensiVAT also provides visual evidence that is used to estimate the number of clusters (cluster tendency assessment) in the data. In our experiments, we compare FensiVAT with seven state-of-the-art approaches which are popular for large sample size or high-dimensional data clustering. Experimental results suggest that FensiVAT, which can cluster large volumes of high-dimensional datasets in a few seconds, is the fastest and most accurate method of the ones tested.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Analyzing depressions plays an important role in meteorology, especially in the study of cyclones. In particular, the study of the temporal evolution of cyclones requires a robust depression tracking framework. To cope with this demand we propose a pipeline for the exploration of cyclones and their temporal evolution. This entails a generic framework for their identification and tracking. The fact that depressions and cyclones are not well-defined objects and their shape and size characteristics change over time makes this task especially challenging. Our method combines the robustness of topological approaches and the detailed tracking information from optical flow analysis. At first cyclones are identified within each time step based on well-established topological concepts. Then candidate tracks are computed from an optical flow field. These tracks are clustered within a moving time window to distill dominant coherent cyclone movements, which are then forwarded to a final tracking step. In contrast to previous methods our method requires only a few intuitive parameters. An integration into an exploratory framework helps in the study of cyclone movement by identifying smooth, representative tracks. Multiple case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in tracking cyclones, both in the northern and southern hemisphere.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many data-driven personalized services require that private data of users is scored against a trained machine learning model. In this paper we propose a novel protocol for privacypreserving classification of decision trees, a popular machine learning model in these scenarios. Our solutions is composed out of building blocks, namely a secure comparison protocol, a protocol for obliviously selecting inputs, and a protocol for multiplication. By combining some of the building blocks for our decision tree classification protocol, we also improve previously proposed solutions for classification of support vector machines and logistic regression models. Our protocols are information theoretically secure and, unlike previously proposed solutions, do not require modular exponentiations. We show that our protocols for privacy-preserving classification lead to more efficient results from the point of view of computational and communication complexities. We present accuracy and runtime results for 7 classification benchmark datasets from the UCI repository.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Community-driven Question Answering (CQA) services on the Internet enable users to share content in the form of questions and answers. Nonetheless, questions usually attract multiple answers of varying quality from the user community. For this reason, the purpose of this paper is to identify high quality answers from a group of candidate answers obtained from semantically similar questions that match with the new question. To do so, a three-component quality framework comprising social, textual and content-appraisal features of user-generated answers in CQA services was developed and tested on Yahoo&amp;#x00026;#x0021; Answers. The results of our logistic regression analysis revealed content-appraisal features to be the strongest predictor of quality in user-generated answers. Specifically, these features include dimensions such as comprehensiveness, truthfulness and practicality. Going forward, the quality framework developed in this paper may be used to pave the way for more robust CQA services.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social media provides flexible platforms that play key roles in energizing collective action in movements like Arab Spring (AS) and Occupy Wall Street (OWS). By enabling individuals to display emotions broadly, social media amplify sentiments defined as shared collective emotion to supply the forces that drive change in society. This study describes how one platform, Facebook, contributed to these two different examples of political activism. Using social network analytics and text mining, we examine how Fan Page posts during the life of the movements influenced the formation of social ties by using sentimental messaging. We hypothesize a set of relationships between group cohesion and polarity of sentiments in explaining involvement. We find that the strength of social ties formed through exchanges of posts and comments influence participation, but its effect differs across two movements. We also find that negative sentiments are associated with more participation for Egypt during the AS than OWS. Our results suggest cultural differences play a major role in participation behaviors. Social media is important in engineering management, because someone who has a negative reaction to a project or a product can use these media to reach thousands of individuals and potentially turn sentiment against a project.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recent vision and learning studies show that learning compact hash codes can facilitate massive data processing with significantly reduced storage and computation. Particularly, learning deep hash functions has greatly improved the retrieval performance, typically under the semantic supervision. In contrast, current unsupervised deep hashing algorithms can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to either the relaxed optimization or absence of similarity-sensitive objective. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised hashing framework, named Similarity-Adaptive Deep Hashing (SADH), which alternatingly proceeds over three training modules: deep hash model training, similarity graph updating and binary code optimization. The key difference from the widely-used two-step hashing method is that the output representations of the learned deep model help update the similarity graph matrix, which is then used to improve the subsequent code optimization. In addition, for producing high-quality binary codes, we devise an effective discrete optimization algorithm which can directly handle the binary constraints with a general hashing loss. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of SADH, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts by large gaps.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of the information and Internet technology, public opinions with big data will rapidly emerge in an online-offline social network, and an inefficient management of public opinions often will lead to security crises for either firms or governments. To unveil the interaction mechanism among a large number of agents between the online and offline social networks, this paper proposes a public opinion dynamics model in an online-offline social network context. Within a theoretical framework, the analytical conditions to form a consensus in the public opinion dynamics model are investigated. Furthermore, extensive simulations to investigate how the online agents impact the dynamics of public opinion formation are conducted, which unfold that online agents shorten the steady-state time, decrease the number of opinion clusters, and smooth opinion changes in the opinion dynamics. The increase of online agents often enhances these effects. The results in this paper can provide a basis for the management of public opinions in the Internet age.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is rapidly becoming ubiquitous. However the heterogeneous nature of devices and protocols in use, the sensitivity of the data contained within, as well as the legal and privacy issues, make security for the IoT a growing research priority and industry concern. With many security practices being unsuitable due to their resource intensive nature, it is deemed important to include second line defences into IoT networks. These systems will also need to be assessed for their efficacy in a variety of different network types and protocols. To shed light on these issues, this paper is concerned with advancements in intrusion detection practices in IoT. It provides a comprehensive review of current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for IoT technologies, focusing on architecture types. A proposal for future directions in IoT based IDS are then presented and evaluated. We show how traditional practices are unsuitable due to their inherent features providing poor coverage of the IoT domain. In order to develop a secure, robust and optimised solution for these networks, the current research for intrusion detection in IoT will need to move in a different direction. An example of which is proposed in order to illustrate how malicious nodes might be passively detected.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Web post and user stance labeling is challenging not only because of the informality and variation in language on the Web but also because of the lack of labeled data on fast-emerging new topics&amp;#x2014;even the labeled data we do have are usually heavily skewed. In this paper, we propose a joint user-post approach for stance labeling to mitigate the latter two difficulties. In labeling post stances, the proposed approach considers post content as well as posting and liking behavior, which involves users. Sentiment analysis is applied to posts to acquire their initial stance, and then the post and user stance are updated iteratively with correlated posting-related actions. The whole process works with few labeled data, which solves the first problem. We use the real interactions between authors and readers for stance labeling. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only substantially improves content-based post stance labeling, but also achieves better performance for the minor stance class, which solves the second problem.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Messages posted to social media in the aftermath of a natural disaster are not only useful for detecting the event itself.More importantly, mining such deliberately dropped digital traces allows a precise situational awareness, from which disaster's consequences on population and infrastructures can be timely estimated.Yet, to date, the automatic assessment of damage has received little attention. Here, the authors explore feeding predictive models by tweets conveying on-the-ground social sensors observations to nowcast the perceived intensity of earthquakes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Systems thinking characterizes the paradigm needed to effectively design, maintain, and utilize systems. Prior work has shown that there is a language of systems thinking and that its presence can be quantified within text using supervised learning methods. Building on this foundation, we present a human-in-the-loop methodology that utilizes topic models to facilitate the identification of systems thinking within a corpus of documents. Though explorative, it requires no manual grading of documents, which makes it significantly faster than previous methods. The methodology uses each document&amp;#x0027;s topic proportion within a systems thinking topic as a proxy measure for the potential of strong systems thinking. The novel aspect of the methodology is in the seeding of the corpus; the user encourages the emergence of the systems thinking topic by adding several documents that demonstrate strong systems thinking to the corpus. Additionally, seeding could be used with concepts other than systems thinking. A Tukey test on a graded corpus reveals that the top echelons of strong systems thinking papers have significantly higher mean topic proportions in the systems thinking topic than lower graded papers. Additionally, a case study on a corpus of Army documents related to the development, character, and management of soldiers demonstrates the methodology&amp;#x0027;s effectiveness in overviewing a system and in providing research direction. The definition of strong systems thinking and the interpretation of topics are subjective, but the methodology overcomes this hurdle by leveraging human intuition and keeping a human in the loop.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many interactional archetypes from outside of learning contexts are being adapted and widely used for online learning environments without consideration for some of the side effects relevant to learner outcomes. Of particular concern is the effectiveness of help exchange in these learning environments. To address this need, this article explores how the reputation system features of up/downvoting, badges, and displayed expertise impact student helper selection in a peer help exchange system within a MOOC discussion forum. We draw from Expectancy Value Theory for Help Sources as a theoretical framework for positioning the work. Results from our field experiment show that up/downvoting has a negative impact on help seeking which is mitigated by the positive effect of Help Giver badges. The mechanism behind these results are then explored in a survey experiment investigating reputation systems impact on students expectancies, values, and costs for a help source.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Sensor based wearable system is a promising platform to monitor the health and movement of human in real time to improve the quality of life. However, it places stringent requirements on communication delay, energy efficiency and throughput. In this paper, an Adaptive Beaconing MAC (AB-MAC) protocol is proposed to reduce communication delay and improve throughput and energy efficiency for duty cycle based wearable system. AB-MAC protocol belongs to receiver initiated (RI) MAC protocol, where the sender keeps listening the channel to send data while the receiver sends beacons actively for the preparation of receiving data when it becomes awake. AB-MAC protocol exploits the unbalance energy consumption in the network, where the nodes near the sink (or hub) consume more energy than that of nodes far away from the hub. AB-MAC protocol makes efficient use of the remaining energy of the nodes far away from the hub to send more beacons during the sleep time, which can decrease the sleep delay and improves the energy efficiency and throughput. In addition, the number of beacons that can be sent for the nodes is also obtained based on the remaining energy level. The theoretical analysis is conducted for analyzing the performance of AB-MAC protocol. Furthermore, experimental results are provided, which demonstrate that compared with RI-MAC protocol, AB-MAC protocol can reduce the delay by 32&amp;#x0025;-51&amp;#x0025;, increase the throughput by 45&amp;#x0025;-116&amp;#x0025;, and improve the energy efficiency by 12&amp;#x0025;-21&amp;#x0025; without sacrificing the network lifetime.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>To address the issues like identity theft and security threats, a continuously evolving technology known as biometrics is presently being deployed in a wide range of personal, government, and commercial applications. Despite the great progress in the field, several exigent problems have yet to be addressed to unleash biometrics full potential. This article aims to present an overview of biometric research and more importantly the significant progress that has been attained over the recent years. The paper is envisaged to further not only the understanding of general audiences and policy makers but also interdisciplinary research. Most importantly, this article is intended to complement earlier articles with updates on most recent topics and developments related to e.g. spoofing, evasion, obfuscation, face reconstruction from DNA, Big data issues in biometrics, etc.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Diffusion of information is a key factor in many social and political situations. This work presents a strategic game called &quot;Spread-It,&quot; which models the spread of information through social network structures. In the game, two competing parties must decide on the allocation and timing of their limited resources with the goal of increasing their influence in the network. Since present decisions affect the future level of network penetration, their effort allocation must be carefully planned. The work starts by defining the mathematical characteristics of the game, followed by analytical results derived by implementing several strategies for winning the game. Analyzing the experiments provides few observations regarding the role of influencers (&quot;hubs&quot;) under different game conditions, the superiority of Monte Carlo tree search strategy over traditional game-tree search methods, and the budget required to guarantee the game's finalization.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We propose a novel hybrid imaging system to acquire 4D high-speed hyperspectral (HSHS) videos with high spatial and spectral resolution. The proposed system consists of two branches: one branch performs Nyquist sampling in the temporal dimension while integrating the whole spectrum, resulting in a high-frame-rate panchromatic video; the other branch performs compressive sampling in the spectral dimension with longer exposures, resulting in a low-frame-rate hyperspectral video. Owing to the high light throughput and complementary sampling, these two branches jointly provide reliable measurements for recovering the underlying HSHS video. Moreover, the panchromatic video can be used to learn an over-complete 3D dictionary to represent each band-wise video sparsely, thanks to the inherent structural similarity in the spectral dimension. Based on the joint measurements and the self-adaptive dictionary, we further propose a simultaneous spectral sparse (3S) model to reinforce the structural similarity across different bands and develop an efficient computational reconstruction algorithm to recover the HSHS video. Both simulation and hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hyperspectral videos can be acquired at a frame rate up to 100fps with commodity optical elements and under ordinary indoor illumination.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow systems to interact with each other over the network. Modern Web APIs often adhere to the REST architectural style, being referred to as RESTful Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs are decomposed into multiple resources (e.g., a video in the YouTube API) that clients can manipulate through HTTP interactions. Testing Web APIs is critical but challenging due to the difficulty to assess the correctness of API responses, i.e., the oracle problem. Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by exploiting relations (so-called metamorphic relations) among multiple executions of the program under test. In this paper, we present a metamorphic testing approach for the detection of faults in RESTful Web APIs. We first propose six abstract relations that capture the shape of many of the metamorphic relations found in RESTful Web APIs, we call these Metamorphic Relation Output Patterns (MROPs). Each MROP can then be instantiated into one or more concrete metamorphic relations. The approach was evaluated using both automatically seeded and real faults in six subject Web APIs. Among other results, we identified 60 metamorphic relations (instances of the proposed MROPs) in the Web APIs of Spotify and YouTube. Each metamorphic relation was implemented using both random and manual test data, running over 4.7K automated tests. As a result, 11 issues were detected (3 in Spotify and 8 in YouTube), 10 of them confirmed by the API developers or reproduced by other users, supporting the effectiveness of the approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A substantial amount of information in companies and on the Internet is present in the form of text. The value of this semi-structured and unstructured data has been widely acknowledged, with consequent scientific and commercial exploitation. The ever-increasing data production, however, pushes data analytic platforms to their limit. Compression as an effective means to reduce data size has been employed by many emerging data analytic platforms, whom the main purpose of data compression is to save storage space and reduce data transmission cost over the network. Since general purpose compression methods endeavour to achieve higher compression ratios by leveraging data transformation techniques and contextual data, this context-dependency forces the access to the compressed data to be sequential. Processing such compressed data in parallel, such as desirable in a distributed environment, is extremely challenging. This work proposes techniques for more efficient textual big data analysis with an emphasis on content-aware compression schemes suitable for the Hadoop analytic platform. The compression schemes have been evaluated for a number of standard MapReduce analysis tasks using a collection of public and private real-world datasets. In comparison with existing solutions, they have shown substantial improvement in performance and significant reduction in system resource requirements.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Complex networks have become high-dimensional, sparse and redundant due to the rapid expansion of the Internet. Effective link prediction techniques are needed to obtain the most relevant and important information for Internet users. A new link prediction algorithm based on the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) as the evaluation metric is proposed in this paper. In the method, the AUC is treated as the objective function, and the link prediction problem is transformed into an optimization problem. A group of topological features is defined for each ordered pair of nodes. By using those features as the attributes of the node pairs, link prediction can be treated as a binary classification, where the class label of each node pair is determined by the existence of a directed link between the node pair. Then, the binary classification problem can be solved by AUC optimization. According to the empirical results, high-quality predictions can be achieved by our algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The amount of digital data produced worldwide is exponentially growing. While the source of this data, collectively known as Big Data, varies from among mobile services to cyber physical systems and beyond, the invariant is their increasingly rapid growth for the foreseeable future. Immense incentives exist, from marketing campaigns to forensics and to research in social sciences, that motivate processing increasingly bigger data so as to extract information and knowledge so as to improve processes and benefits. Consequently, the need for more efficient computing systems tailored to such big data applications is increasingly intensified. Such custom architectures would expectedly embrace heterogeneity to better match each phase of the computation. In this paper we review state of the art as well as envisioned future large-scale computing architectures customized for batch processing of big data applications in the MapReduce paradigm. We also provide our view of current important trends relevant to such systems, and their impacts on future architectures and architectural features expected to address the needs of tomorrow big data processing in this paradigm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We study the problem of video classification for facial analysis and human action recognition. We propose a novel weakly supervised learning method that models the video as a sequence of automatically mined, discriminative sub-events (eg. onset and offset phase for &amp;#x201C;smile&amp;#x201D;, running and jumping for &amp;#x201C;highjump&amp;#x201D;). The proposed model is inspired by the recent works on Multiple Instance Learning and latent SVM/HCRF - it extends such frameworks to model the ordinal aspect in the videos, approximately. We obtain consistent improvements over relevant competitive baselines on four challenging and publicly available video based facial analysis datasets for prediction of expression, clinical pain and intent in dyadic conversations and on three challenging human action datasets. We also validate the method with qualitative results and show that they largely support the intuitions behind the method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) allows datacenters to consolidate network appliance functions onto commodity servers and devices. Currently telecommunication carriers are re-architecting their central offices as NFV datacenters that, along with SDN, help network service providers to speed deployment and reduce cost. However, it is still unclear how a carrier network shall organize its NFV datacenter resources into a coherent service architecture to support global network functional demands. This work proposes a hierarchical NFV/SDN-integrated architecture in which datacenters are organized into a multi-tree overlay network to collaboratively process user traffic flows. The proposed architecture steers traffic to a nearby datacenter to optimize user-perceived service response time. Our experimental results reveal that the 3-tier architecture is favored over others as it strikes a good balance between centralized processing and edge computing, and the resource allocation should be decided based on traffic&amp;#8217;s source-destination attributes. Our results indicate that when most traffic flows within the same edge datacenter, the strategy whereby resources are concentrated at the carrier&amp;#8217;s bottom-tier datacenters is preferred, but when most traffic flows across a carrier network or across different carrier networks, a uniform distribution over the datacenters or over the tiers, respectively, stands out from others.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Object detection is one of the most important topics in computer vision task and has obtained impressive performance thanks to the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Network. For object detection, especially in still image, it has achieved excellent performance during past two years, such as the series of R-CNN, which plays a vital role in improving performance. However, with the number of surveillance videos increasing, the current methods may not meet the growing demand. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Moving-Object Proposals Generation and Prediction Framework (MPGP) to reduce the searching space and generate some accurate proposals which can reduce computational cost. In addition, we explore the relation of moving regions in feature map of different layers and predict candidates according to the results of previous frames. Last but not least, we utilize spatial-temporal information to strengthen the detection score and further adjust the location of the bounding boxes. Our MPGP framework can be applied to different region-based networks. Experiments on CUHK dataset, XJTU dataset and AVSS dataset, show that our approach outperforms the state-of-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the remarkable proliferation of intelligent mobile devices and fast growing broadband wireless technology, social networking is undergoing explosive growth in recent years as more and more users access social networks via mobile platforms. It is often expensive or even impossible to deploy a large online social network (OSN) on a single server. A cost-effective approach is horizontal scaling, where the OSN is partitioned and deployed on a set of low-cost servers. In this research, we study the problem of minimum-cost balanced partitioning of OSNs. Our goal is to achieve the best partitioning by minimizing the total inter-server traffic cost and at the same time balancing the load among servers. Given its NP-hardness, we propose new techniques and explore efficient heuristics to address the problem, especially for extremely large OSNs with an enormous volume of social nodes, social connections, and social data. Our key contributions include a localized approach with &lt;formula&gt; &lt;tex&gt;$O(\delta^2)$&lt;/tex&gt; &lt;/formula&gt; complexity to explicitly calculate the projected gain in inter-server traffic cost (named Server Change Benefit (SCB)). Built upon this technique, we devise two algorithms that offer online and offline solutions to achieving minimum-cost balanced partitioning of OSNs. The online algorithm is fast and highly efficient to process newly arrival individual nodes. The offline algorithm uses the current online result as a starting point. It further reduces inter-server traffic cost by applying relocation and swapping. It employs a merging process to group the nodes according to the social structure and swap the groups with similar size to further reduce the total inter-server traffic cost. We implement both algorithms and evaluate them based on a variety of real-world OSN datasets from Facebook, Arxiv, Gnutella, Amazon, and Twitter. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the execution time by an average of three fold- and at the same time yield supreme performance (i.e., inter-server traffic cost) in comparison with existing solutions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Identifying trustworthy information in the presence of noisy data contributed by numerous unvetted sources from online social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) has been a crucial task in the era of big data. This task, referred to as truth discovery, targets at identifying the reliability of the sources and the truthfulness of claims they make without knowing either a priori. In this work, we identified three important challenges that have not been well addressed in the current truth discovery literature. The first one is &quot;misinformation spread&quot; where a significant number of sources are contributing to false claims, making the identification of truthful claims difficult. For example, on Twitter, rumors, scams, and influence bots are common examples of sources colluding, either intentionally or unintentionally, to spread misinformation and obscure the truth. The second challenge is &quot;data sparsity&quot; or the &quot;long-tail phenomenon&quot; where a majority of sources only contribute a small number of claims, providing insufficient evidence to determine those sources&amp;#x0027; trustworthiness. For example, in the Twitter datasets that we collected during real-world events, more than 90% of sources only contributed to a single claim. Third, many current solutions are not scalable to large-scale social sensing events because of the centralized nature of their truth discovery algorithms. In this paper, we develop a Scalable and Robust Truth Discovery (SRTD) scheme to address the above three challenges. In particular, the SRTD scheme jointly quantifies both the reliability of sources and the credibility of claims using a principled approach. We further develop a distributed framework to implement the proposed truth discovery scheme using Work Queue in an HTCondor system. The evaluation results on three real-world datasets show that the SRTD scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art truth discovery methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficienc- .</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In medical cloud computing, a patient can remotely outsource her medical data to the cloud server. In this case, only authorized doctors are allowed to access the data since the medical data is highly sensitive. Encrypting the data before outsourcing is a commonly used approach, where the patient only needs to send the corresponding encryption key to the authorized doctors. This, however, significantly limits the usability of outsourced medical data due to the difficulty of searching over the encrypted data. In this paper, we propose two Secure and Efficient Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SEDSSE) schemes over medical cloud data. Firstly, we leverage the secure k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) techniques to propose a dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme, which can achieve two important security features, i.e., forward privacy and backward privacy which are very challenging in the area of dynamic searchable symmetric encryption. Then, we propose an enhanced scheme to solve the key sharing problem which widely exists in the kNN based searchable encryption scheme. Compared with existing proposals, our schemes are better in terms of storage, search and updating complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our schemes on storage overhead, index building, trapdoor generating and query.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The literature examining the relationship between green supply chain management and firm performance has expanded greatly in recent years. Although researchers maintain that green supply chain management can bring positive financial performance, to date they have ignored the moderating role of the social control mechanism, especially in the context of China. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study aims to contribute to the literature in this field by proposing social control as an effective mechanism to strengthen the impact of green supply chain management on firms&amp;#x2019; financial performance. Today, most empirical literature in the field of green supply chain management adopts the static view and overlooks the contextual factors. This study addresses the gap by investigating the green supply chain management in an environment characterized by frequently unavoidable disruptions, and the effectiveness of social control that accommodates this complexity and dynamism. By examining green supply chain management under conditions of environmental dynamism, this study contributes to the literature of interface of green supply chain and resilience. Using a sample of 185 Chinese manufacturers, the theoretical model is empirically verified. The research findings indicate that in a dynamic environment, the joint effect of social control and green supply chain management practices is positive and significant. This paper also discusses the theoretical contribution and managerial implications of the study, outlines the research limitations, and provides recommendations for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Background extraction is generally the first step in many computer vision and augmented reality applications. Most existing methods, which assume the existence of a clean background during the reconstruction period, are not suitable for video sequences such as highway traffic surveillance videos, whose complex foreground movements may not meet the assumption of a clean background. Therefore, we propose a novel joint Gaussian conditional random field (JGCRF) background extraction algorithm for estimating the optimal weights of frame composition for a fixed-view video sequence. A maximum a posteriori problem is formulated to describe the intra- and inter-frame relationships among all pixels of all frames based on their contrast distinctness and spatial and temporal coherence. Because all background objects and elements are assumed to be static, patches that are motionless are good candidates for the background. Therefore, in the algorithm method, a motionless extractor is designed by computing the pixel-wise differences between two consecutive frames and thresholding the accumulation of variation across the frames to remove possible moving patches. The proposed JGCRF framework can flexibly link extracted motionless patches with desired fusion weights as extra observable random variables to constrain the optimization process for more consistent and robust background extraction. The results of quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms; the proposed algorithm also produced fewer artifacts and had a lower computational cost.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We are living in a cyber-physical-social environment with a variety of lifestyles and values. Living support has become important in such a diverse society. Owing to the ability to collect a large amount of personal data or life logs in the cyber-physical-social environment, it is now possible for us to provide living support based on personal data analysis. Moreover, analyzing such data can facilitate a deep understanding of an individual. In this study, we focus on the provision of cyber-enabled well-being oriented daily living support for an individual based on personal data analytics. Three categories of personal data are identified from an individual&amp;#x0027;s daily life data. In this paper, we discuss the basic concept, model, and framework for well-being oriented personal data analysis in order to offer suggestions and advice to improve the living quality of an individual. Finally, we report a feasibility study with an application scenario by using personal and environmental data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Software testing is one of the key activities to software quality in practice. Despite its importance, however, we have a remarkable lack of knowledge on how developers test in real-world projects. In this paper, we report on the surprising results of a large-scale field study with 2,443 software engineers whose development activities we closely monitored over the course of 2.5 years in four Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Our findings question several commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about developer testing: half of the developers in our study does not test; developers rarely run their tests in the IDE; only once they start testing, do they do it heftily; most programming sessions end without any test execution; only a quarter of test cases is responsible for three quarters of all test failures; 12% of tests show flaky behavior; Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and software developers only spend a quarter of their time engineering tests, whereas they think they test half of their time. We observed only minor differences in the testing practices among developers in different IDEs, Java, and C#. We summarize these practices of loosely guiding ones development efforts with the help of testing as Test-Guided Development (TGD).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Stress is a complex phenomenon that impacts the body and the mind at several levels. It has been studied for more than a century from different perspectives, which result in different definitions and different ways to assess the presence of stress. This paper introduces a methodology for analyzing multimodal stress detection results by taking into account the variety of stress assessments. As a first step, we have collected video, depth and physiological data from 25 subjects in a stressful situation: a socially evaluated mental arithmetic test. As a second step, we have acquired 3 different assessments of stress: self-assessment, assessments from external observers and assessment from a physiology expert. Finally, we extract 101 behavioural and physiological features and evaluate their predictive power for the 3 collected assessments using a classification task. Using multimodal features, we obtain average F1 scores up to 0.85. By investigating the composition of the best selected feature subsets and the individual feature classification performances, we show that several features provide valuable information for the classification of the 3 assessments: features related to body movement, blood volume pulse and heart rate. From a methodological point of view, we argue that a multiple assessment approach provide more robust results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The multiobjective realisation of the data clustering problem has shown great promise in recent years, yielding clear conceptual advantages over the more conventional, single-objective approach. Evolutionary algorithms have largely contributed to the development of this increasingly active research area on multiobjective clustering. Nevertheless, the unprecedented volumes of data seen widely today pose significant challenges and highlight the need for more effective and scalable tools for exploratory data analysis. This paper proposes an improved version of the multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination algorithm. Our new algorithm improves its predecessor in several respects, but the key changes are related to the use of an efficient, specialised initialisation routine and two alternative reduced-length representations. These design components exploit information from the minimum spanning tree and redefine the problem in terms of the most relevant subset of its edges. Our study reveals that both the new initialisation routine and the new solution representations not only contribute to decrease the computational overhead, but also entail a significant reduction of the search space, enhancing therefore the convergence capabilities and overall effectiveness of the method. These results suggest that the new algorithm proposed here will offer significant advantages in the realm of &amp;#x2018;big data&amp;#x2019; analytics and applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Evaluation is an essential part of any software development process as it helps compare intended with actual outcomes and identify possible improvements. To do this, it is important to understand how users interact with the product. As interactions with the interdisciplinary product category of Serious Games can be multifaceted, pure text-logging of gameplay actions is not always sufficient to cover all aspects needed to satisfy researchers&amp;#x0027; needs, for instance how the user feels or what s/he thinks while carrying out a certain action. For this reason, studies evaluating serious games are increasingly applying multimodal methods in recent years. This makes it important to establish theoretical foundations considering the changing research landscape. This paper presents a theoretical framework for multimodal Serious Games evaluation based on a review of relevant research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A synthetic voice personifies the system using it. In this work we examine the impact text content, voice quality and synthesis system have on the perceived personality of two synthetic voices. Subjects rated synthetic utterances based on the Big-Five personality traits and naturalness. The naturalness rating of synthesis output did not correlate significantly with any Big-Five characteristic except for a marginal correlation with openness. Although text content is dominant in personality judgments, results showed that voice quality change implemented using a unit selection synthesis system significantly affected the perception of the Big-Five, for example tense voice being associated with being disagreeable and lax voice with lower conscientiousness. In addition a comparison between a parametric implementation and unit selection implementation of the same voices showed that parametric voices were rated as significantly less neurotic than both the text alone and the unit selection system, while the unit selection was rated as more open than both the text alone and the parametric system. The results have implications for synthesis voice and system type selection for applications such as personal assistants and embodied conversational agents where developing an emotional relationship with the user, or developing a branding experience is important.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Scene classification has been successfully applied to the semantic interpretation of large high-resolution images (HRIs). The bag-of-words (BOW) model has been proven to be effective but inadequate for HRIs because of the complex arrangement of the ground objects and the multiple types of land cover. How to define the scenes in HRIs is still a problem for scene classification. The previous methods involve selecting the scenes manually or with a fixed spatial distribution, leading to scenes with a mixture of objects from different categories. In this paper, to address these issues, a scene capture method using adjacent segmented images and a support vector machine classifier is proposed to generate scenes dominated by one category. The codebook in BOW is obtained from clustering features extracted from all the categories, which may lose the discrimination in some vocabularies. Thus, more discriminative visual vocabularies are selected by the introduced mutual information and the proposed intraclass variability balance in each category, to decrease the redundancy of the codebook. In addition, a refined fuzzy classification strategy is presented to avoid misclassification in similar categories. The experimental results obtained with three different types of HRI data sets confirm that the proposed method obtains classification results better than those obtained by most of the previous methods in all the large HRIs, demonstrating that the selection of representative vocabularies, the refined fuzzy classification, and the scene capture strategy are all effective in improving the performance of scene classification.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile cellular network operators spend nearly a quarter of their revenue on network management and maintenance. Incidentally, a significant proportion of that budget is spent on resolving outages that degrade or disrupt cellular services. Historically, operators mainly rely on human expertise to identify, diagnose and resolve such outages. However, with growing cell density and diversifying cell types, this approach is becoming less and less viable, both technically and financially. To cope with this problem, research on Self-healing solutions has gained significant momentum in recent years. Self-healing solutions either assist in resolving these outages or carry out the task autonomously without human intervention, thus reducing costs while improving mobile cellular network reliability. However, despite their growing popularity, to this date no survey has been undertaken for Self-healing solutions in mobile cellular networks. This study aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive survey of Self-healing solutions proposed in the domain of mobile cellular networks, along with an analysis of the techniques and methodologies employed in those solutions. This article begins by providing a quantitative analysis to highlight why in emerging mobile cellular network Self-healing will become a necessity instead of a luxury. Building on this motivation, the article provides a review and taxonomy of existing literature on Self-healing. Challenges and prospective research directions for developing Self-healing solutions for emerging and future mobile cellular networks are also discussed in detail. Particularly, we identify that the most demanding challenges from Self-healing perspective are the difficulty of meeting 5G low latency and the high quality of experience requirement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>It has been shown that the emotional state of students plays an important role towards with learning; for instance, engaged concentration is positively correlated with learning. This paper proposes the Inductive Control (IC) for educational games. Unlike conventional approaches that only modify the game level, the proposed technique also induces emotions in the player for supporting the learning process. This paper explores a fuzzy system that analyzes the players&amp;#x0027; performance and their emotional state for controlling the level and aesthetic content of an educational video game. The emotional state of the player is recognized through voice analysis. A total of 40 subjects played a video game designed to practice basic math skills; for each trial, a student plays two times in a row the same game but each time the game was controlled by one of the two approaches ---Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) and IC, the playing order was assigned randomly. Results show that when the proposed approach is used the participants changed faster from unpleasant--low to pleasant or high emotions. These experiments demonstrate that the inductive control technique improves the learning effectiveness through detection and stimulation of positive emotions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The explosion of mobile applications and phenomenal adoption of mobile connectivity by end users has generated an increasing amount of mobile data traffic. Cognizant of the need of increasing network capacity, cooperative Device-to-Device (D2D) communications and efficient power allocation have been proposed to address the imperative problem. Existing works mainly focus on relay selection and power control at physical layer. The social connections between mobile users, however, are omitted in consideration of improving the cooperative D2D communication quality. Leveraging social trust, we propose an innovation social-aware energy-efficient relay selection (SERS) mechanism that considers the hidden social ties among mobile users to ensure more users are willing to participate in the cooperative communications. The proposed SERS takes both social and physical constraints into account to determine the best choice of rely devices. In SERS, we further develop an optimization problem based on game theory, aiming at reducing energy consumption and interference. In the game, social distance is treated as penalty coefficient and performs distributed control of the transmission power for D2D communications. Simulations based on real-world social network data traces show that SERS achieves a significant performance gain, compared to other relay selection approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, mass-customization and on-demand production have spread to larger ground. To accommodate these developments, manufacturing systems are being transformed to allow more flexibility and agility. One of the technologies that allow flexibility and agility is Collaborative Robots. The design and implementation of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems is a complex activity that requires bridging between disciplines. With the introduction of Collaborative Robots, new disciplines are added to this activity, that need to be linked to existing design methods and procedures. Currently, the lack of these links is a bottleneck for Small and Medium sized Enterprises. These have limited resources for implementation. In this article, we introduce a Human-Robot Coproduction Design Methodology, with the aim of raising the capacity of Intelligent Manufacturing System designers for reasoning on collaboration between humans and robots in manufacturing. The methodology comprises four procedural steps: analysis, modeling, simulation, and evaluation, with specific methods, tools and instruments. The methodology has been evaluated in a laboratory environment by performing a pilot study with designers. While the current implementation of the methodology and its instrumentation is limited, it has been shown that the methodology enables quick design iterations during the conceptual design phase of Human-Robot Coproduction, thanks to procedures that have been tailored for this novel form of organizing and structuring production processes in Intelligent Manufacturing Systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of community-contributed images. Hashing-based similarity search for social images has been attacking considerable interest from computer vision and multimedia communities due to its computational and memory efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised hashing method named Weakly-supervised Multimodal Hashing (WMH for short), for scalable social image retrieval. Semantic-aware hash functions are learned by jointly leveraging the weakly-supervised tag information and visual information. Specifically, due to that user-provided tags associated with social images can describe the semantic information, the hash functions are learned by exploring the semantic structure. Unfortunately, the user-provided tags are imperfect. To avoid overfitting the weakly-supervised tags, the local discriminative structure and the geometric structure in the visual space are explored. Besides, to learn compact and non-redundant hash codes, the hash functions are constrained to be orthogonal and an information theoretic regularization based on the maximum entropy principle is introduced to maximize the information provided by each hash code. The learned hash functions are orthogonal, which can avoid redundancy in the learned hash codes as much as possible. The proposed hashing learning problem is formulated as the eigenvalue problem, which can be solved efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used social image datasets and the encouraging performance compared with state-of-the-art hashing techniques demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Understanding the world we live in requires access to a large amount of background knowledge: the common sense knowledge that most people know and most computer systems don't. Many of the limitations of artificial intelligence today relate to the problem of acquiring and understanding common sense. The Open Mind Common Sense project began to collect common sense from volunteers on the Internet starting in 2000. The collected information is converted to a semantic network called ConceptNet. Reducing the dimensionality of ConceptNet's graph structure gives a matrix representation called AnalogySpace, which reveals large-scale patterns in the data, smooths over noise, and predicts new knowledge. Extending this work, we have created a method that uses singular value decomposition to aid in the integration of systems or representations. This technique, called blending, can be harnessed to find and exploit correlations between different resources, enabling common sense reasoning over a broader domain.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Personalized trip recommendation has drawn much attention recently with the development of location-based services. How to utilize the data in the location-based social network to recommend a single Point of Interest (POI) or a sequence of POIs for users is an important question to answer. Recommending the latter is called trip recommendation that is a challenging study because of the diversity of trips and complexity of involved computation. This work proposes a maximal-marginal-relevance-based personalized trip recommendation method that considers both relevance and diversity of trips in trip planning. An ant-colony-optimization-based trip planning algorithm is developed to efficiently plan a trip. Finally, case studies and experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Though representing a promising approach for personalization, targeting, and recommendation, aggregation of user profiles from multiple social networks will inevitably incur a serious privacy leakage issue. In this paper, we propose a Novel Heterogeneous De-anonymization Scheme (NHDS) aiming at de-anonymizing heterogeneous social networks. NHDS firstly leverages the network graph structure to significantly reduce the size of candidate set, then exploits user profile information to identify the correct mapping users with a high confidence. Performance evaluation on real-world social network datasets shows that NHDS significantly outperforms the prior schemes. Finally, we perform an empirical study on privacy leakage arising from cross-network aggregation based on four real-world social network datasets. Our findings show that 39.9% more information is disclosed through de-anonymization and the de-anonymized ratio is 84%. The detailed privacy leakage of user demographics and interests is also examined, which demonstrates the practicality of the identified privacy leakage issue.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we propose a system infrastructure to construct the big scholar data as a large knowledge graph, discover the meta paths between the entities and calculate the relevancy between entities in the graph . The core infrastructure is established on the secured and private Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) platform. The infrastructure maintains the data evenly across the repositories, processes the data parallel by utilizing open source Spark framework, manages computing resources optimally by utilizing YARN and Hadoop HDFS, and discovers the relationship distributively between different types of entities. We incorporate four relationship discovery tasks including citation recommendation, potential collaborator discovery, similar venue measurement and paper to venue recommendation on top of this infrastructure. For relationship mining tasks, we propose a mixed and weighted meta path (MWMP) method to explore the potential relationship between different types of entities. To verify the accuracy and measure parallelization speedup of our algorithm, we set up clusters through Amazon EC2 platform.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Entity highlight refers to a short, concise, and characteristic description for an entity, which can be applied to various applications. In this article, we study the problem of automatically generating entity highlights from the descriptive sentences of entities. Specifically, we develop two computational approaches, one is inspired by the statistical machine translation (SMT) and another is a sequence-to-sequence learning (Seq2Seq) approach which has been successfully applied in neural machine translation (NMT) and neural summarization. In the Seq2Seq approach, we use attention mechanism, copy mechanism, and coverage mechanism. To generate entity-specific highlights, we also incorporate entity name into the Seq2Seq model to guide the decoding process. We automatically collect large-scale instances as training data without any manual annotation, and ask annotators to create a test set. We compare with several strong baseline methods, and evaluate the approaches with both automatic evaluation and manual evaluation. Experimental results show that the entity enhanced Seq2Seq model with attention, copy, and coverage mechanisms significantly outperforms all other approaches in terms of multiple evaluation metrics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Entity Set Expansion (ESE) is the problem that expands a small set of seed entities into a more complete set, entities of which have common traits. As a popular data mining task, ESE has been widely used in many applications, such as dictionary construction and query suggestion. Existing ESE methods mainly utilize text and Web information. That is, the intrinsic relation among entities is inferred from their occurrences in text or Web. With the surge of knowledge graph in recent years, it is possible to extend entities according to their occurrences in knowledge graph. In this paper, we consider the knowledge graph as a heterogeneous information network (HIN) that contains different types of objects and links, and propose a novel method, called MP_ESE, to extend entities. MP_ESE employs meta paths, a relation sequence connecting entities, to capture the implicit common traits of seed entities. An automatic meta path generation method, called SMPG,has been designed to exploit the potential relations among entities. Heuristic and PU learning methods are employed to learn the weights of extracted meta paths. With these generated and weighted meta paths, MP_ESE can effectively extend entities. Comprehensive experiments on real datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of MP_ESE</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In 2014, more than 10 million people in the US were affected by an ambulatory disability. Thus, gait rehabilitation is a crucial part of health care systems. The quantification of human locomotion enables clinicians to describe and analyze a patient&amp;#x0027;s gait performance in detail and allows them to base clinical decisions on objective data. These assessments generate a vast amount of complex data which need to be interpreted in a short time period. We conducted a design study in cooperation with gait analysis experts to develop a novel Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics solution for clinical Gait analysis (KAVAGait). KAVAGait allows the clinician to store and inspect complex data derived during clinical gait analysis. The system incorporates innovative and interactive visual interface concepts, which were developed based on the needs of clinicians. Additionally, an explicit knowledge store (EKS) allows externalization and storage of implicit knowledge from clinicians. It makes this information available for others, supporting the process of data inspection and clinical decision making. We validated our system by conducting expert reviews, a user study, and a case study. Results suggest that KAVAGait is able to support a clinician during clinical practice by visualizing complex gait data and providing knowledge of other clinicians.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, a new market mechanism is proposed to quantify the value of emergency energy transactions in renewable-based multi-microgrid (MMG) systems. To reach this goal, main requirements and features of such emergency market are identified. Subsequently, a hybrid market framework is proposed which integrates pool emergency transactions and bilateral contracts in order to reduce the system risk in face of different contingency events. For settling different transactions in this market, the main procedure which should be followed by distribution system operator (DSO) to properly address bidding of microgrids (MGs) as well as system technical constraints are introduced. In addition, a simple and efficient method is introduced to determine MGs&amp;#x0027; purchase/sell bids considering available resources and flexible demands. Market settling process and MGs bidding procedure are represented using efficient optimization models and effective-ness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via implementation on a test MMG system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Singular value decomposition (SVD) has been applied in cyber security since it can reduce data. However, SVD is hard to reduce higher-order big data because it is designed for only matrix data initially. Reducing higher-order big data is desired for cyber security applications, and is a very challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel orthogonal tensor SVD method using big data techniques for higher-order big data reduction, which can be extensively used in big data applications of cyber security. More specifically, we firstly present a higher-order Lanczos-based orthogonal tensor SVD algorithm to reduce higher-order data. Then, for utilizing the incomparable benefits of cloud, we develop a secure orthogonal tensor SVD method to outsource the computation task of the orthogonal tensor SVD algorithm to cloud. The secure orthogonal tensor SVD method can protect data security from untrusted cloud by applying garbled circuits to the orthogonal tensor SVD algorithm. Finally, we analyze the security and efficiency of our proposed orthogonal tensor SVD on synthetic dataset and real network intrusion detection dataset, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method is promising for big data reduction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Advances in mobile Internet technology have enabled the clients of Web services to be able to keep their service sessions alive while they are on the move. Since the services consumed by a mobile client may be different over time due to client location changes, a multi-dimensional spatiotemporal model is necessary for analyzing the service consumption relations. Moreover, competitive Web service recommenders for the mobile clients must be able to predict unknown quality-of-service (QoS) values well by taking into account the target client&amp;#x2019;s service requesting time and location, e.g., performing the prediction via a set of multi-dimensional QoS measures. Most contemporary QoS prediction methods exploit the QoS characteristics for one specific dimension, e.g., time or location, and do not exploit the structural relationships among the multi-dimensional QoS data. This paper proposes an integrated QoS prediction approach which unifies the modeling of multi-dimensional QoS data via multi-linear-algebra based concepts of tensor and enables efficient Web service recommendation for mobile clients via tensor decomposition and reconstruction optimization algorithms. In light of the unavailability of measured multi-dimensional QoS datasets in the public domain, this paper also presents a transformational approach to creating a credible multi-dimensional QoS dataset from a measured taxi usage dataset which contains high dimensional time and space information. Comparative experimental evaluation results show that the proposed QoS prediction approach can result in much better accuracy in recommending Web services than several other representative ones.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Interactive visualization of large image collections is important and useful in many applications, such as personal album management and user profiling on images. However, most prior studies focus on using low-level visual features of images, such as texture and color histogram, to create visualizations without considering the more important semantic information embedded in images. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic system to analyze images in a semantic-aware manner. The system mainly comprises two components: a semantic information extractor and a visual layout generator. The semantic information extractor employs an image captioning technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce descriptive captions for images, which can be transformed into semantic keywords. The layout generator employs a novel co-embedding model to project images and the associated semantic keywords to the same 2D space. Inspired by the galaxy metaphor, we further turn the projected 2D space to a multi-scale galaxy visualization of images, in which semantic keywords and images are visually encoded as stars and planets. Users can iteratively refine the visual layout by integrating their domain knowledge into the co-embedding process. Two task-based evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Films elicit emotions in viewers by infusing the story they tell with an affective character or tone &amp;#x2014; in a word, a mood. Considerable effort has been made recently to develop computational methods to estimate affective content in film. However, these efforts have focused almost exclusively on style-based features while neglecting to consider different scene types separately. In this study, we investigated the quantitative determinants of film mood across scenes classified by their setting and use of sounds. We examined whether viewers could assess film mood directly in terms of hedonic tone, energetic arousal, and tense arousal; whether their mood ratings differed by scene type; and how various narrative and stylistic film attributes as well as low- and high-level computational features related to the ratings. We found that the viewers were adept at assessing film mood, that sound-based scene classification brought out differences in the mood ratings, and that the low- and high-level features related to different mood dimensions. The study showed that computational film mood estimation can benefit from scene type classification and the use of both low- and high-level features. We have made our clip assessment and annotation data as well as the extracted computational features publicly available.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Computer games provide an ideal test bed to collect and study data related to human behavior using a virtual environment having real-world-like features. Studies regarding individual players&amp;#x0027; actions in a gaming session and how this correlates with their real-life personality have the potential to reveal great insights in the field of affective computing. This study profiles players using data collected from strategy games. This is done by taking into account the gameplay and the associations between the personality traits and the subjects playing the game. This study uses two benchmark strategy game datasets, namely, StarCraft and World of Warcraft. In addition, the study also uses the Age of Empire-II game data, collected using 50 participants. The IPIP-NEO-120 personality test is conducted using these participants to evaluate them on the Big-Five personality traits. The three datasets are profiled using four clustering techniques. The results identify two clusters in each of these datasets. The quality of cluster formation is also evaluated through the cluster evaluation indices. Using the clustering results, the classifiers are then trained to classify a player, after a gameplay, into one of the two profiles. Results show that the gameplay can be used to predict various personality features using strategy game data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Emotion labels are usually obtained via either manual annotation, which is tedious and time-consuming, or questionnaires, which neglect the time-varying nature of emotions and depend on human&amp;#x0027;s unreliable introspection. To overcome these limitations, we developed a continuous, real-time, joystick-based emotion annotation framework. To assess the same, 30 subjects each watched 8 emotion-inducing videos. They were asked to indicate their instantaneous emotional state in a valence-arousal (V-A) space, using a joystick. Subsequently, five analyses were undertaken: (i) a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire unveiled the framework&amp;#x0027;s excellent usability; (ii) MANOVA analysis of the mean V-A ratings and (iii) trajectory similarity analyses of the annotations confirmed the successful elicitation of emotions; (iv) Change point analysis of the annotations, revealed a direct mapping between emotional events and annotations, thereby enabling automatic detection of emotionally salient points in the videos; and (v) Support Vector Machines (SVM) were trained on classification of 5 second chunks of annotations as well as their change-points. The classification results confirmed that ratings patterns were cohesive across the participants. These analyses confirm the value, validity, and usability of our annotation framework. They also showcase novel tools for gaining greater insights into the emotional experience of the participants.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, state-of-the-art speaker diarization and linking systems heavily rely on between-recording variability compensation methods to accurately process large collections of recordings. Variability estimation is performed on consequent training datasets, which must be labeled by speaker. One major problem of such systems is the acoustic mismatch between training and target data that degrades performances. Most of the collections contain lots of speakers speaking in various acoustic conditions. In this paper, we investigate how the imperfect knowledge of those speakers can help improve between-recording variability estimation, to overcome the mismatch issue. We propose a scalable unsupervised adaptation framework for two types of variability compensation. The proposed framework consists in adapting a state-of-the-art diarization and linking system, trained on &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$out-domain data$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;, using the data of the collection itself. Experiments in mismatch condition are run on two French Television shows, while the initial training dataset is composed of Radio recordings. Results indicate that the proposed adaptation framework reduces the cross-recording DER of 13% in average for variable collection sizes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Database outsourcing is a common cloud computing paradigm that allows data owners to take advantage of its on-demand storage and computational resources. The main challenge is maintaining data confidentiality with respect to untrusted parties i.e., cloud service provider, as well as providing relevant query results in real-time to authenticated users. Existing approaches either compromise confidentiality of the data or suffer from high communication cost between the server and the user. To overcome this problem, we propose a dual transformation and encryption scheme for spatial data, where encrypted queries are executed entirely at the service provider on the encrypted database and encrypted results are returned to the user. The user issues encrypted spatial range queries to the service provider and then uses the encryption key to decrypt the query response returned. This allows a balance between the security of data and efficient query response as the queries are processed on encrypted data at the cloud server. Moreover, we compare with existing approaches on large datasets and show that this approach reduces the average query communication cost between the authorized user and service provider, as only a single round of communication is required by the proposed approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Linkages are essentially determined by similarity measures that may be derived from multiple perspectives. For example, spatial linkages are usually generated based on localities of heterogeneous data. Semantic linkages, however, can come from even more properties, such as different physical meanings behind social relations. Many existing metric learning models focus on spatial linkages but leave the rich semantic factors unconsidered. We propose a Unified Multi-Metric Learning &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$({mathrm{UM^2L)}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; framework to exploit multiple types of metrics with respect to overdetermined similarities between linkages. In &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${mathrm{UM^2L}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;, a type of combination operator is introduced for distance characterization from multiple perspectives, and thus can introduce flexibilities for representing and utilizing both spatial and semantic linkages. Besides, we propose a uniform solver for &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${mathrm{UM^2L}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;, and the theoretical analysis reflects the generalization ability of &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${mathrm{UM^2L}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; as well. Extensive experiments on diverse applications exhibit the superior classification performance and comprehensibility of &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;${mathrm{UM^2L}}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;. Visualization results also validate its ability on physical meanings discovery.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays research is heading towards the integration of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) thus creating a Cloud of Things (CoT). This combination generates a new paradigm for pervasive and ubiquitous computing. However, reliable CoT-based services, particularly, highly delay-sensitive services, such as, healthcare, require energy-efficient CoT architectures. Considerable efforts have been proposed to improve the efficiency of CoT architectures. This paper analyses CoT architectures and platforms, as well as the implementation of CoT in the context of smart healthcare. Subsequently, the paper explains some related issues of CoT, including the lack of standardization. Moreover, it focuses on energy efficiency with an in depth analysis of the most relevant proposals available in the literature. An evaluation of all the energy efficiency solutions investigated in this paper shows there is still a need to improve energy efficiency, especially regarding QoS and performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Effective leadership bears strong relationship to attributes of emotion contagion, positive mood, and social intelligence. In fact, leadership quality has been shown to be manifested in the exhibited communicative behaviors, especially in settings of public speaking. While studies on the theories of leadership has received much attention, little has progressed in terms of the computational development in its measurements. In this work, we present a behavioral signal processing (BSP) research to assess the qualities of oral presentations in the domain of education, in specific, we propose a multimodal framework toward automating the scoring process of pre-service school principals&amp;#x0027; oral presentations given at the yearly certification program. We utilize a dense unit-level audio-video feature extraction approach with session-level behavior profile representation techniques based on bag-of-word and Fisher-vector encoding. Furthermore, we design a scoring framework, inspired by the psychological evidences of human&amp;#x0027;s decision-making mechanism, to use confidence measures outputted from support vector machine classifier trained on the distinctive set of data samples as the regressed scores. Our proposed approach achieves an absolute improvement of 0.049 (9.8% relative) on average over support vector regression. We further demonstrate that the framework is reliable and consistent compared to human experts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Crowdsourcing has been shown to be effective in a wide range of applications, and is seeing increasing use. A large-scale crowdsourcing task often consists of thousands or millions of atomic tasks, each of which is usually a simple task such as binary choice or simple voting. To distribute a large-scale crowdsourcing task to limited crowd workers, a common practice is to pack a set of atomic tasks into a task bin and send to a crowd worker in a batch. It is challenging to decompose a large-scale crowdsourcing task and execute batches of atomic tasks, which ensures reliable answers at a minimal total cost. Large batches lead to unreliable answers of atomic tasks, while small batches incur unnecessary cost. In this paper, we investigate a general crowdsourcing task decomposition problem, called the Smart Large-scAle task DEcomposer (SLADE) problem, which aims to decompose a large-scale crowdsourcing task to achieve the desired reliability at a minimal cost. We prove the NP-hardness of the SLADE problem and propose solutions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. For the homogeneous SLADE problem, where all the atomic tasks share the same reliability requirement, we propose a greedy heuristic algorithm and an efficient and effective approximation framework using an optimal priority queue (OPQ) structure with provable approximation ratio. For the heterogeneous SLADE problem, where the atomic tasks can have different reliability requirements, we extend the OPQ-based framework leveraging a partition strategy, and also prove its approximation guarantee. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions through extensive experiments on representative crowdsourcing platforms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We extend the concept of graph isomorphisms to multilayer networks with any number of &amp;#x201C;aspects&amp;#x201D; (i.e., types of layering). In developing this generalization, we identify multiple types of isomorphisms. For example, in multilayer networks with a single aspect, permuting vertex labels, layer labels, and both vertex labels and layer labels each yield different isomorphism relations between multilayer networks. Multilayer network isomorphisms lead naturally to defining isomorphisms in any of the numerous types of networks that can be represented as a multilayer network, and we thereby obtain isomorphisms for multiplex networks, temporal networks, networks with both of these features, and more. We reduce each of the multilayer network isomorphism problems to a graph isomorphism problem, where the size of the graph isomorphism problem grows linearly with the size of the multilayer network isomorphism problem. One can thus use software that has been developed to solve graph isomorphism problems as a practical means for solving multilayer network isomorphism problems. Our theory lays a foundation for extending many network analysis methods &amp;#x2014; including motifs, graphlets, structural roles, and network alignment &amp;#x2014; to any multilayer network.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Attribute reduction with many patterns and indicators has been regarded as an important approach for large-scale data mining and machine learning tasks. However, it is extremely difficult for researchers to inadequately extract knowledge and insights from multiple overlapping and interdependent fuzzy datasets from the current changing and interconnected big data sources. This paper proposes a deep neuro-cognitive co-evolution for fuzzy attribute reduction (DNCFAR) that contains a combination of quantum leaping particle swarm optimization with nearest-neighbor memeplexes. A key element of DNCFAR resides in its deep neuro-cognitive cooperative co-evolution structure, which is explicitly permitted to identify interdependent variables and adaptively decompose them in the same neuro-subpopulation, with minimizing the complexity and nonseparability of interdependent variables among different fuzzy attribute subsets. Next DNCFAR formalizes to the different types of quantum leaping particles with nearest-neighbor memeplexes to share their respective solutions and deeply cooperate to evolve the assigned fuzzy attribute subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that DNCFAR can achieve competitive performance in terms of average computational efficiency and classification accuracy while reinforcing noise tolerance. Furthermore, it can be well applied to clearly identify different longitudinal surfaces of infant cerebrum regions, which indicates its great potential for brain disorder prediction based on fMRI.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Along with the popularity of mobile social networks (MSNs) is the increasing danger of privacy breaches due to user location exposures. In this work, we take an initial step towards quantifying location privacy leakage from MSNs by matching the users&amp;#x2019; shared locations with their real mobility traces. We conduct a three-week real-world experiment with 30 participants and discover that both direct location sharing (e.g., Weibo or Renren) and indirect location sharing (e.g., Wechat or Skout) can reveal a small percentage of users&amp;#x2019; real points of interests (POIs). We further propose a novel attack to allow an external adversary to infer the demographics (e.g., age, gender, education) after observing users&amp;#x2019; exposed location profiles. We implement such attack in a large real-world dataset involving 22,843 mobile users. The experimental results show that the attacker can effectively predict demographic attributes about users with some shared locations. To resist such attacks, we propose SmartMask, a context-based system-level privacy protection solution, designed to automatically learn users&amp;#x2019; privacy preferences under different contexts and provide a transparent privacy control for MSN users. The effectiveness and efficiency of SmartMask have been well validated by extensive experiments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile devices have several restrictions due to design choices that guarantee their mobility. A way of surpassing such limitations is to utilize cloud servers called cloudlets on the edge of the network through Mobile Edge Computing. However, as the number of clients and devices grows, the service must also increase its scalability in order to guarantee a latency limit and quality threshold. This can be achieved by deploying and activating more cloudlets, but this solution is expensive due to the cost of the physical servers. The best choice is to optimize the resources of the cloudlets through an intelligent choice of configuration that lowers delay and raises scalability. Thus, in this paper we propose an algorithm that utilizes Virtual Machine Migration and Transmission Power Control, together with a mathematical model of delay in Mobile Edge Computing and a heuristic algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization, to balance the workload between cloudlets and consequently maximize cost-effectiveness. Our proposal is the first to consider simultaneously communication, computation, and migration in our assumed scale and, due to that, manages to outperform other conventional methods in terms of number of serviced users.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Crowdsourcing is emerging as an alternative outsourcing strategy which is gaining increasing attention in the software engineering community. However, crowdsourcing software development involves complex tasks which differ significantly from the micro-tasks that can be found on crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk which are much shorter in duration, are typically very simple, and do not involve any task interdependencies. To achieve the potential benefits of crowdsourcing in the software development context, companies need to understand how this strategy works, and what factors might affect crowd participation. We present a multi-method qualitative and quantitative theory-building research study. Firstly, we derive a set of key concerns from the crowdsourcing literature as an initial analytical framework for an exploratory case study in a Fortune 500 company. We complement the case study findings with an analysis of 13,602 crowdsourcing competitions over a ten-year period on the very popular Topcoder crowdsourcing platform. Drawing from our empirical findings and the crowdsourcing literature, we propose a theoretical model of crowd interest and actual participation in crowdsourcing competitions. We evaluate this model using Structural Equation Modeling. Among the findings are that the level of prize and duration of competitions do not significantly increase crowd interest in competitions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Geographic information, especially represented by Points of Interest (POIs), is critical for identifying locations and provides the basis for various location-based services. Currently, geospatial data of POI are available through some open map services (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, etc.). However, the data supporting these services are either collected through the expensive commercial purchasing and company investment or gathered by the volunteered contribution of high uncertainty.With the rapid geospatial data growing on the Web, we propose an automatic approach of extracting geographic information for building up POI resources based on the results obtained by the web search engines to mitigate the negative effect from the traditional means. According to the approach, we firstly put the types of POIs extracted from Google Maps and the street names obtained from OpenStreetMap into the Google search engine, and then retrieve the potential addresses of POIs through parsing the search results. Secondly, the Google search engine is employed again with the retrieved addresses of POIs to extract the potential place names. Finally, the Google search engine is employed for a third time with learning both the place names and the corresponding addresses to verify whether the place names are correct. The contributed output of the work is a place-name dataset. We respectively select 20 blocks in Chicago and Houston in U.S. to execute our approach for verifying the research contribution. In the experiments, we choose Google Map that is of high data quality as the reference and compare the results with those from OpenStreetMap and Wikimapia. The final results indicate that the proposed approach could effectively produce the place-name datasets on a par with Google Maps and outperform OpenStreetMap and Wikimapia.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has made electric transportation a popular research topic. The demand for EV charging resources has significantly reshaped the net demand profile of power distribution systems. This paper proposes an online optimal charging strategy for multiple EV charging stations in distribution systems with power flow and bus voltage constraints satisfied. First, we formulate the online optimal charging problem as an OPF problem that minimizes the total system energy cost based on short-term predictive models and operates in a time-receding manner with latest system information. Then, the problem is convexified by a modified convex relaxation technique based on the bus injection model, so that the globally optimal solution can be obtained with high efficiency. Moreover, a distributed MPC-based scheme is designed to solve the optimization problem per concerns regarding data privacy, individual economic interests and EV uncertainties. The obtained optimal schedules are dispatched to the EVs parked at each charging station according to a fuzzy rule which guarantees full charging at the departure time for each vehicle. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation on a modified IEEE 15-bus distribution system with charging stations located in both residential and commercial areas.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We consider the problem of fusing probability scores from a set of classifiers to estimate a final fused probability score. Our interest is in scenarios where the classifiers are statistically dependent. To that end, we propose a new classifier fusion approach that is data driven and founded on the statistical theory of copulas. Numerical results with both simulated and real data show that our copula based classifier fusion approach produces better probability scores than individual classifiers and outperforms existing probability score fusion approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>At present, searchable encryption is a very promising direction in the field of cloud computing. However, most existing works focus on keyword-based search schemes and regardless of personalized search needs, a keyword-based search does not take into account the user&amp;#x2019;s location information and cannot exactly match users&amp;#x2019; search intentions. Since location information is very important in mobile searches, we propose a personalized mobile search (PRMS) over encrypted outsourced data, and we convert the user&amp;#x2019;s location information into distance information to generate the user location model, forming a location query matrix with user location information. The matrix is then used to encrypt the user&amp;#x2019;s location query and conceal location information in the location query matrix. In this paper, we combine a user&amp;#x2019;s interest preference and location information in personalized searches over encrypted outsourced data, adopt the law of universal gravitation to calculate scores of files in the cloud, and return the first K results with the highest gravitational forces. For the first time, we propose a PRMS&amp;#x005F;improvement scheme that is applied to an encryption method to build the content index and location index, which can greatly reduce the time for model construction. Through the PRMS scheme, we realized personalized mobile searches based on user&amp;#x2019;s interests and location information.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Training time is a costly, scarce resource across domains such as commercial aviation, healthcare, and military operations. In the context of military applications, serious gaming -- the training of warfighters through immersive, real-time environments rather than traditional classroom lectures -- offers benefits to improve training not only in its hands-on development and application of knowledge, but also in data analytics via machine learning. In this paper, we explore an array of machine learning techniques that allow teachers to visualize the degree to which training objectives are reflected in actual play. First, we investigate the concept of discovery: learning how warfighters utilize their training tools and develop military strategies within their training environment. Second, we develop machine learning techniques that could assist teachers by automatically predicting player performance, identifying player disengagement, and recommending personalized lesson plans. These methods could potentially provide teachers with insight to assist them in developing better lesson plans and tailored instruction for each individual student.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The proliferation of private clouds that are often underutilized and the tremendous computational potential of these clouds when combined has recently brought forth the idea of volunteer cloud computing (VCC), a computing model where cloud owners contribute underutilized computing and/or storage resources on their clouds to support the execution of applications of other members in the community. This model is particularly suitable to solve big data scientific problems. Scientists in data-intensive scientific fields increasingly recognize that sharing volunteered resources from several clouds is a cost-effective alternative to solve many complex, data- and/or compute-intensive science problems. Despite the promise of the idea of VCC, it still remains at the vision stage at best. Challenges include the heterogeneity and autonomy of member clouds, access control and security, complex inter-cloud virtual machine scheduling, etc. In this paper, we present CloudFinder, a system that supports the efficient execution of big data workloads on volunteered federated clouds (VFCs). Our evaluation of the system indicates that VFCs are a promising cost-effective approach to enable big data science.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents LISSA (&quot;Learning dashboard for Insights and Support during Study Advice&quot;), a learning analytics dashboard designed, developed, and evaluated in collaboration with study advisers. The overall objective is to facilitate communication between study advisers and students by visualising grade data that is commonly available in any institution. More specifically, the dashboard attempts to support the dialogue between adviser and student through an overview of study progress, peer comparison, and by triggering insights based on facts as a starting point for discussion and argumentation. We report on the iterative design process and evaluation results of a deployment in 97 advising sessions. We have found that the dashboard supports the current adviser-student dialogue, helps them motivate students, triggers conversation and provides tools to add personalisation, depth, and nuance to the advising session. It provides insights at a factual, interpretative, and reflective level and allows both adviser and student to take an active role during the session.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is an innovative manufacturing paradigm in which geographically distributed various manufacturing resources are encapsulated into manufacturing services (MSs), and also these MSs can provide users with various services. Users can find and choose qualified MSs to form cliques to help them complete their manufacturing tasks via Internet. Trust makes cooperative endeavors happen. Hence, it is an important problem to evaluate the trustworthiness of MSs in CMfg. In this paper, we present a comprehensive assessment approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of a MS in CMfg. The approach evaluates a MS from both subjective and objective perspectives, named as credit assessment and reliability assessment respectively. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) analysis is presented to assess the credit of a MS, while fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used to assess its reliability. Finally, a case study is presented and the results show the comprehensive assessment approach is efficacious at the trustworthiness evaluation of a MS.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper surveys the literature of opportunistic offloading. Opportunistic offloading refers to offloading traffic originally transmitted through the cellular network to opportunistic network, or offloading computing tasks originally executed locally to nearby devices with idle computing resources through opportunistic network. This research direction is recently emerged, and the relevant research covers the period from 2009 to date, with an explosive trend over the last four years. We provide a comprehensive review of the research field from a multi-dimensional view based on application goal, realizing approach, offloading direction, etc. In addition, we pinpoint the major classifications of opportunistic offloading, so as to form a hierarchical or graded classification of the existing works. Specifically, we divide opportunistic offloading into two main categories based on application goal: traffic offloading or computation offloading. Each category is further divided into two smaller categories: with and without offloading node selection, which bridges between subscriber node and the cellular network, or plays the role of computing task executor for other nodes. We elaborate, compare and analyze the literatures in each classification from the perspectives of required information, objective, etc. We present a complete introductory guide to the researches relevant to opportunistic offloading. After summarizing the development of the research direction and offloading strategies of the current state-of-the-art, we further point out the important future research problems and directions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>For the upcoming Internet of Things (IoT) enabled era, context-aware service provisioning (CaSP) can be realized by first analyzing new input data, followed by inferring contexts from the input data, and providing new services based on the inferred contexts. Over time, further new contextual models will also be incorporated into CaSP due to growing data collected by existing or new IoT devices. Furthermore, these contextual models require ongoing adaptation because a real-life environment is dynamic in nature. It becomes more challenging to maintain and adapt these ever-increasing contextual models as the system evolves. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a CaSP infrastructure along with an agentized and reconfigurable design to improve system adaptability and extensibility. The proposed middleware-enhanced CaSP infrastructure can keep as much previously learned knowledge as possible to share among all integrated components. This design reduces the overhead from integrating and adapting multiple contextual models in response to inevitable uncertainties in a dynamically changing IoT-enabled smart home environment. Our agentized design generalizes the scheme of all smart components integrated with the CaSP infrastructure, thus facilitating reciprocal cooperation among all initially independent components. The CaSP infrastructure can facilitate multilevel rather than single-level information reuse via message queues residing in the middleware. This reconfigurable design enables all of the smart components to become loosely coupled and flexibly interconnect to form reconfigurable agents. Such a design allows temporal reconfiguration by reusing as many existing or even new features and contexts on the CaSP infrastructure, thus improving extensibility. Our experimental results show that the proposed CaSP infrastructure can improve the overall adaptability (by about 20&amp;#x0025;) and extensibility (by 44&amp;#x0025; to 95&amp;#x0025;)- of CaSP in a dynamic environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Crime is one of the most important social problems in the country, affecting public safety, children development, and adult socioeconomic status. We tackle a fundamental problem in our paper: crime rate inference at the neighborhood level. Traditional approaches have used demographics and geographical influences to estimate crime rates in a region. With the fast development of positioning technology and prevalence of mobile devices, a large amount of modern urban data have been collected and such big data can provide new perspectives for understanding crime. In this paper, we used large-scale Point-Of-Interest data and taxi flow data in the city of Chicago, IL in the USA. We observed significantly improved performance in crime rate inference compared to using traditional features. Such an improvement is consistent over multiple years. We also show that these new features are significant in the feature importance analysis. The correlations between crime and various observed features are not constant over the whole city. In order to address this geospatial non-stationary property, we further employ the geographically weighted regression on top of negative binomial model (GWNBR). Experiments have shown the GWNBR has better performance than the negative binomial model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social sensing is a new big data application paradigm for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where a group of individuals volunteer (or are recruited) to report measurements or observations about the physical world at scale. A fundamental challenge in social sensing applications lies in discovering the correctness of reported observations and reliability of data sources without prior knowledge on either of them. We refer to this problem as truth discovery. While prior studies have made progress on addressing this challenge, two important limitations exist: (i) current solutions did not fully explore the uncertainty aspect of human reported data, which leads to sub-optimal truth discovery results; (ii) current truth discovery solutions are mostly designed as sequential algorithms that do not scale well to large-scale social sensing events. In this paper, we develop a Scalable Uncertainty-Aware Truth Discovery (SUTD) scheme to address the above limitations. The SUTD scheme solves a constraint estimation problem to jointly estimate the correctness of reported data and the reliability of data sources while explicitly considering the uncertainty on the reported data. To address the scalability challenge, the SUTD is designed to run a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) with thousands of cores, which is shown to run two to three orders of magnitude faster than the sequential truth discovery solutions. In evaluation, we compare our SUTD scheme to the state-ofthe- art solutions using three real world datasets collected from Twitter: Paris Attack, Oregon Shooting, and Baltimore Riots, all in 2015. The evaluation results show that our new scheme significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of both truth discovery accuracy and execution time.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we study how to address the sparsity, accuracy and serendipity issues of top-N recommendation with Collaborative Filtering (CF). Existing studies commonly use rated items (which form only a small section in a rating matrix) or import some additional information (e.g., details about the items and users) to improve the performance of CF. Unlike these methods, we propose a novel notion towards a huge amount of unrated items: Serendipity item. By utilizing serendipity items, we propose Concise Satisfaction and Interest Injection (CSII), a method that can effectively find interesting, satisfying and serendipitous items in unrated items. By preventing uninteresting and unsatisfying items to be recommended as top-N items, this concise-but-novel method improves accuracy and recommendation quality (especially serendipity) substantially. Meanwhile, it can address the sparsity and cold-start issues by enriching the rating matrix in CF without additional information. As our method tackles rating matrix before recommendation procedure, it can be applied to most existing CF methods, such as item-based CF, user-based CF and Matrix Factorization-based CF. Through comprehensive experiments using abundant real-world datasets with LensKit implementation, we successfully demonstrate that our solution improves the performance of existing CF methods consistently and universally. Moreover, comparing with baseline methods, CSII can extract uninteresting items more carefully and cautiously, avoiding potential items inferred by mistake.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>For an unfamiliar Application Programming Interface (API), software developers often access the official documentation to learn its usage, and post questions related to this API on social question and answering (Q&amp;A) sites to seek solutions. The official software documentation often captures the information about functionality and parameters, but lacks detailed descriptions in different usage scenarios. On the contrary, the discussions about APIs on social Q&amp;A sites provide enriching usages. In this paper, we present CnCxL2R, a software documentation recommendation strategy incorporating the content of official documentation and the social context on Q&amp;A into a learning-to-rank schema. In the proposed strategy, the content, local context and global context of documentation are considered to select candidate documents. Then four types of features are extracted to learn a ranking model. We conduct a large-scale automatic evaluation on Java documentation recommendation. The results show that CnCxL2R achieves state-of-the-art performance over the eight baseline models. We also compare the CnCxL2R with Google search. The results show that CnCxL2R can effectively capture the semantic between the high-level intent in developers&amp;#x0027; queries and the low-level implementation in software documentation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Health 4.0 can provide effective ways to improve the health status of subjects by taking advantage of Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things technologies for the solution of health care problems. One of these is represented by suitably estimating blood pressure values of subjects in a continuous, real-time and non-invasive way. To address it, we propose an approach only requiring a photoplethysmography sensor and a mobile/desktop device. The approach avails itself of Genetic Programming to automatically find an explicit relationship between blood pressure values and photoplethysmography ones. This relationship is tested on a set of eleven subjects and compared against other regression methods, and turns out to be better. Namely, the Root Mean Square Error values are equal to 8.49 and 6.66 for the systolic and the diastolic BP values, respectively. Those for the relative error, instead, are equal to 5.55% for the systolic and 6.59% for the diastolic values.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>All engineering disciplines are founded and rely on models, although they may differ on purposes and usages of modeling. Among the different disciplines, the engineering of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) particularly relies on models with dynamic behaviors (i.e., models that exhibit time-varying changes). The Simulink modeling platform greatly appeals to CPS engineers since it captures dynamic behavior models. It further provides seamless support for two indispensable engineering activities: (1) automated verification of abstract system models via model simulation, and (2) automated generation of system implementation via code generation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the last decade, machine-learning-based compilation has moved from an obscure research niche to a mainstream activity. In this paper, we describe the relationship between machine learning and compiler optimization and introduce the main concepts of features, models, training, and deployment. We then provide a comprehensive survey and provide a road map for the wide variety of different research areas. We conclude with a discussion on open issues in the area and potential research directions. This paper provides both an accessible introduction to the fast moving area of machine-learning-based compilation and a detailed bibliography of its main achievements.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we study physical layer message authentication with perfect security for wireless networks, regardless of the computational power of adversaries. Specifically, we propose an efficient and feasible authentication scheme based on Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and &amp;#x03B5;-AU2 hash functions over Binary-input Wiretap Channel (BIWC). Firstly, a multi-message authentication scheme for noiseless main channel case is presented by leveraging a novel &amp;#x03B5;-AU2 hash function family and the dual of large-girth LDPC codes. Concretely, the sender Alice first generates a message tag T with message M and key K by using a lightweight &amp;#x03B5;-AU2 hash functions; then Alice encodes T to a codeword Xn with the dual of large-girth LDPC codes; finally, Alice sends (M,Xn) to the receiver Bob noiselessly. An adversary Eve has infinite computational capacity, and he can obtain M and the output Zn of the BEC with input Xn. Then, an authentication scheme over binary erasure channel and binary-input wiretapper&amp;#x2019;s channel is further developed, which can reduce the noisy main channel case to noiseless main channel case by leveraging public discussion. We theoretically prove that, the proposed schemes are perfect secure if the number of attacks from Eve is upper bounded by a polynomial times in terms of n. Furthermore, the simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve high authentication rate with low time latency.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The key question we address is whether interactivity in a virtual environment (VE) impacts conceptual learning. We developed a Virtual Reality (VR) application to simulate a playground, in which children had to engage in tasks that required solving arithmetical fractions problems. Fifty (50) children were tested in an empirical study with different conditions that varied the levels of interactivity and immersion, from a fully interactive to a non-immersive and non-interactive activity with LEGOs. A methodological framework, where quantitative and qualitative analyses complement each other, was developed to analyze children&amp;#x0027;s activity. Our findings from the quantitative analysis showed that participants in the VEs seemed to have a greater overall gain than those that did not perform the activity in VR but did not clarify whether interactivity in the VE was the defining factor in this gain. The qualitative analysis indicated that it was the &amp;#x201C;passive&amp;#x201D; VR condition which provided evidence of sustained conceptual change. With countless educational VR applications becoming available nowadays to the public due to VR&amp;#x0027;s recent resurgence in prominence through inexpensive headsets, the study of the effect of VE attributes, such as interactivity, is timely.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Network embedding task aims at learning low-dimension latent representations of vertices while preserving the structure of a network simultaneously. Most existing network embedding methods mainly focus on static networks, which extract and condense the network information without temporal information. However, in the real world, networks keep evolving, where the linkage states between the same vertex pairs at consequential timestamps have very close correlations. In this paper, we propose to study the network embedding problem and focus on modeling the linkage evolution in the dynamic network setting. To address this problem, we propose a deep dynamic network embedding method. More specifically, the method utilizes the historical information obtained from the network snapshots at past timestamps to learn latent representations of the future network. In the proposed embedding method, the objective function is carefully designed to incorporate both the network internal and network dynamic transition structures. Extensive empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed model on various categories of real-world networks, including a human contact network, a bibliographic network and email networks. Furthermore, the experimental results also demonstrate the significant advantages of the method compared with both the state-of-the-art embedding techniques and several existing baseline methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the advantages of low handover latency and signaling costs, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), as a localized mobility management protocol for next generation mobile network, can be well combined with VANETs. However, the lack of security considerations limits the rapid growth of PMIPv6. Unfortunately, few proposals are in the literature to address such issue. Motivated by this, a novel authentication scheme based on identity-based signature for PMIPv6 is proposed. Mutual authentication between mobile node (MN) and mobile access gateway (MAG) is achieved for both intra-domain and inter-domain scenarios with the help of identity-based signature and service-level agreement. The authentication signaling can be finely integrated into the mobility management procedure of PMIPv6, which equips our scheme with high authentication efficiency. The formal security proof under SVO logic and the performance analysis are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our proposed scheme.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper summarizes the state of the art in connected vehicles--from the need for vehicle data and applications thereof, to enabling technologies, challenges, and identified opportunities. Connectivity is increasing around the world and its expansion to vehicles is no exception. With improvements in connectivity, sensing, and computation, the future will see vehicles used as development platforms capable of generating rich data, acting based on inference, and effecting great change in transportation, the human-vehicle dynamic, the environment, and the economy. Connected vehicle technologies have already been used to improve fleet safety and efficiency, with emerging technologies additionally allowing data to be used to inform aspects of vehicle design, ownership, and use. While the demand for connected vehicles and its enabling technology has progressed significantly in recent years, there remain challenges to connected and collaborative vehicle application deployment before the full potential of connected cars may be realized. From extensibility and scalability to privacy and security, this paper informs the reader about key enabling technologies, opportunities, and challenges in the connected vehicle landscape.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, a control technique named optimized backstepping is first proposed by implementing tracking control for a class of strict-feedback systems, which considers optimization as a design philosophy of the high-order system control. The basic idea is that designing the actual and virtual controls of backstepping is the optimized solutions of the corresponding subsystems so that overall control of the high-order system is optimized. In general, optimization control is designed based on the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, but solving the equation is very difficult due to the inherent nonlinearity and intractability. In order to overcome the difficulty, the neural network (NN)-based reinforcement learning strategy of actor-critic architecture is used. In every backstepping step, the actor and critic NNs are constructed for executing control behavior and evaluating control performance, respectively. According to the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proven that the desired control performance can be obtained. Finally, a simulation example is carried out to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes a new discriminative deep quantization hashing (DDQH) approach for large-scale face image retrieval by learning discriminative and compact binary codes. It jointly explores the discrete code learning, batch normalization quantization (BNQ) module, and end-to-end learning in one unified framework, which can guarantee the optimal compatibility of hash coding and feature learning. To learn multiscale and robust facial features, a deep network properly stacking several convolution-pooling layers and pooling layers is designed, and the facial features are obtained by fusing the outputs of the last convolutional layer and the last pooling layer. Besides, the prediction errors of the learned binary codes are minimized to learn discriminative binary codes of images. To obtain higher retrieval accuracies, a BNQ module is utilized to control quantization at a moderate level. Experiments are conducted on two widely used data sets, and the proposed DDQH method achieves encouraging improvements over some state-of-the-art hashing approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Most of the existing community detection algorithms are based on vertex connectivity. While in many real networks, each vertex usually has one or more attributes describing its properties which are often homogeneous in a cluster. Such networks can be modeled as attributed graphs, whose attributes sometimes are equally important to topological structure in graph clustering. One important challenge is to detect communities considering both topological structure and vertex properties simultaneously. To this propose, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on structural and attribute similarities (MOEA-SA) is first proposed to solve the attributed graph clustering problems in this paper. In MOEA-SA, a new objective named as attribute similarity SA is proposed and another objective employed is the modularity Q. A hybrid representation is used and a neighborhood correction strategy is designed to repair the wrongly assigned genes through making balance between structural and attribute information. Moreover, an effective multi-individual-based mutation operator is designed to guide the evolution toward the good direction. The performance of MOEA-SA is validated on several real Facebook attributed graphs and several ego-networks with multiattribute. Two measurements, namely density T and entropy E, are used to evaluate the quality of communities obtained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MOEA-SA and the systematic comparisons with existing methods show that MOEA-SA can get better values of T and E in each graph and find more relevant communities with practical meanings. Knee points corresponding to the best compromise solutions are calculated to guide decision makers to make convenient choices.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Future intelligent robots are expected to be able to adapt continuously to their environment. For this purpose, recognizing new objects and learning new words through interactive learning with humans is fundamental. Such setup results in ambiguous teaching data which humans have been shown to address using cross-situational learning, i.e. by analyzing common factors between multiple learning situations. Moreover, they have been shown to be more efficient when actively choosing the learning samples, e.g. which object they want to learn. Implementing such abilities on robots can be performed by latenttopic learning models such as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization or Latent Dirichlet Allocation. These cross-situational learning methods tackle referential and linguistic ambiguities, and can be associated with active learning strategies. We propose two such methods: the Maximum Reconstruction Error based Selection (MRES) and Confidence Base Exploration (CBE). We present extensive experiments using these two learning algorithms through a systematic analysis on the effects of these active learning strategies in contrast with random choice. In addition, we study the factors underlying the active learning by focusing on the use of sample repetition, one of the learning behaviors that have been shown to be important for humans.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Batch steganography refers to a steganography method where a user tries to hide confidential payload within a batch of images from social networks. It is significantly different from the traditional laboratory steganography where a user only considers an individual image. To apply batch steganography in social media networks, we are faced with two nontrivial problems: (a) how to assign payload to multiple images? (b) how to recover the hidden payload if some images are lost during transmission? We tackle the problems by (a) developing an optimal payload embedding strategy and (b) designing a special type of data decomposition. In the former, an optimal non-uniform payload distribution for multiple images are obtained by iterative feature back replacement. In the latter, we employ special matrix operation to expand original data and split them into multiple shares. These shares are then embedded into different covers following the optimal non-uniform payload distribution. Our solution is robust in the sense that the recipient can recover the hidden data even if some images are intercepted or lost during delivery. Comprehensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of anti-detectability and robustness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The massive energy consumption of data centers worldwide has resulted in a large carbon footprint, raising serious concerns to sustainable IT initiatives and attracting a great amount of research attention. Nonetheless, the current efforts to date, despite encouraging, have been primarily centered around owner-operated data centers (e.g., Google data center), leaving out another major segment of data center industry - colocation data centers - much less explored. As a major hindrance to carbon efficiency desired by the operator, colocation suffers from &amp;#x201C;split incentive&amp;#x201D;: tenants may not be willing to manage their servers for carbon efficiency. In this paper, we aim at minimizing the carbon footprint of geo-distributed colocation data centers, while ensuring that the operator&amp;#x0027;s cost meets a long-term budget constraint. We overcome the &amp;#x201C;split incentive&amp;#x201D; hurdle by devising a novel online carbon-aware incentive mechanism, called GreenColo, in which tenants voluntarily bid for energy reduction at self-determined prices and will receive financial rewards if their bids are accepted at runtime. Using trace based simulation we show that GreenColo results in a carbon footprint fairly close (23% vs 18%) to the optimal offline solution with future information, while being able to satisfy the colocation operator&amp;#x0027;s long-term budget constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GreenColo in practical scenarios via both simulation studies and scaled-down prototype experiments. Our results show that GreenColo can reduce the carbon footprint by up to 24% without incurring any additional cost for the colocation operator (compared to the no-incentive baseline case), while tenants receive financial rewards for &amp;#x201C;free&amp;#x201D; without violating service level agreement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is one of the keywords to describe smart cities, aiming at efficient public transport, smart parking, enhanced road safety, intelligent traffic management, on-vehicle entertainment, and so on. In ITS, Roadside Unit (RSU) deployment should be well-designed due to it serves as a service provider and a gateway to the Internet for vehicular users. In this article, we propose an RSU deployment strategy which maximizes the communication coverage and reduces the energy consumption of RSUs, simultaneously. We first formulate a multi-objective optimization RSU deployment problem and solve it by an evolutionary algorithm. Then we conduct extensive simulations and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy significantly improves both the energy efficiency and the network connectivity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Knowledge evolution is a major challenge in knowledge management. When knowledge evolution is conveyed in the form of data streams, a combined approach of deductive and inductive reasoning can leverage the clear separation between the evolving (streaming) and the static parts of the knowledge at the conceptual and technological level. In particular, the notion of RDF streams is the &amp;amp;#x201C;glue&amp;amp;#x201D; for the interoperability of inductive and deductive reasoning techniques with methods and systems for processing data streams. In this paper, we show our combined approach applied to social network analysis, we give experimental evidence of good performances, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for extracting trends from micro-blogs and feeds.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has emerged as a promising technology for optimizing spectral efficiency in future cellular networks. D2D takes advantage of the proximity of communicating devices for efficient utilization of available resources, improving data rates, reducing latency and increasing system capacity. The research community is actively investigating the D2D paradigm to realize its full potential and enable its smooth integration into the future cellular system architecture. Existing surveys on this paradigm largely focus on interference and resource management. We review recently proposed solutions in over explored and under explored areas in D2D. These solutions include protocols, algorithms, and architectures in D2D. Furthermore, we provide new insights on open issues in these areas. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>As the most widely used mobile platform, Android is also the biggest target for mobile malware. Given the increasing number of Android malware variants, detecting malware families is crucial so that security analysts can identify situations where signatures of a known malware family can be adapted as opposed to manually inspecting behavior of all samples. We present EC2 (Ensemble Clustering and Classification), a novel algorithm for discovering Android malware families of varying sizes - ranging from very large to very small families (even if previously unseen). We present a performance comparison of several traditional classification and clustering algorithms for Android malware family identification on DREBIN, the largest public Android malware dataset with labeled families. We use the output of both supervised classifiers and unsupervised clustering to design EC2. Experimental results on both the DREBIN and the more recent Koodous malware datasets show that EC2 accurately detects both small and large families, outperforming several comparative baselines. Furthermore, we show how to automatically characterize and explain unique behaviors of specific malware families, such as FakeInstaller, MobileTx, Geinimi. In short, EC2 presents an early warning system for emerging new malware families, as well as a robust predictor of the family (when it is not new) to which a new malware sample belongs, and the design of novel strategies for data-driven understanding of malware behaviors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We present a system for converting a fully panoramic (360&lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;^{circ}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;) video into a normal field-of-view (NFOV) hyperlapse for an optimal viewing experience. Our system exploits visual saliency and semantics to non-uniformly sample in space and time for generating hyperlapses. In addition, users can optionally choose objects of interest for customizing the hyperlapses. We first stabilize an input 360&lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;^{circ}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; video by smoothing the rotation between adjacent frames and then compute regions of interest and saliency scores. An initial hyperlapse is generated by optimizing the saliency and motion smoothness followed by the saliency-aware frame selection. We further smooth the result using an efficient 2D video stabilization approach that adaptively selects the motion model to generate the final hyperlapse. We validate the design of our system by showing results for a variety of scenes and comparing against the state-of-the-art method through a large-scale user study.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Smartphone user verification is important as personal daily activities are increasingly conducted on the phone and sensitive information is constantly logged. The commonly adopted user verification methods are typically active, i.e., they require a user&amp;#x0027;s cooperative input of a security token to gain access permission. Though popular, these methods impose heavy burden to smartphone users to memorize, maintain and input the token at a high frequency. To alleviate this imposition onto the users and to provide additional security, we propose a new nonintrusive and continuous mobile user verification framework that can reduce the frequency required for a user to input his/her security token. Using tailored Hidden Markov Models and sequential likelihood ratio test, our verification is built on low-cost, readily available, anonymized, and multimodal smartphone data without additional effort of data collection and risk of privacy leakage. With extensive evaluation, we achieve a high rate of about 94% for detecting illegitimate smartphone uses and a rate of 74% for confirming legitimate uses. In a practical setting, this can translate into 74% of frequency reduction of inputting a security token using an active authentication method with only about 6% risk of miss detection of a random intruder, which is highly desirable.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Domain adaptation is the situation for supervised learning in which the training data are sampled from the source domain while the test data are sampled from the target domain that follows a different distribution. The key to solve such problem is to reduce effects of the discrepancy between the training data and test data. Recently, deep learning methods that employ stacked denoising auto-encoders (SDAs) to learn new representations for both domains have been successfully applied in domain adaptation. And remarkable performance on multi-domain sentiment analysis datasets has been reported, making deep learning a promising approach to domain adaptation problems. In this paper, a deep learning method called Stacked Robust Adaptively Regularized Auto-regressions (SRARAs) is proposed to learn useful representations for domain adaptation problems. Each layer of SRARAs contains two steps: a linear transformation step, which is based on robust adaptively regularized auto-regression, and a non-linear squashing transformation step. The first step aims at reducing the discrepancy between the training data and test data, and the second step is to introduce non-linearity and control the range of the elements in the outputs. The experimental results on text and image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this era of big data, stream data classification which is one of typical data stream applications has become more and more significant and challengeable. In these applications, it is obvious that data classification is much more frequent than model training. The ratio of stream data to be classified is rapid and time-varying, so it is an important problem to classify the stream data efficiently with high throughput. In this paper, we first analyze and categorize the current data stream machine learning algorithms according to their data structures. Then, we propose stream data classification topology (SDC-Topology) on Storm. For the classification algorithms based on the matrix, we propose self-adaptive stream data classification framework (SASDC-Framework) for efficient stream data classification on Storm. In SASDC-Framework, all the data sets arriving at the same unit time are partitioned into subsets with the nearly best partition size and processed in parallel. To select the nearly best partition size for the stream data sets efficiently, we adopt bisection method strategy and inverse distance weighted strategy. Extreme learning machine, which is a fast and accurate machine learning method based on matrix calculating, is used to test the efficiency of our proposals. According to evaluation results, the throughputs based on SASDC-Framework are 8-35 times higher than those based on SDC-Topology and the best throughput is more than 40,000 prediction requests per second in our environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Owing to the variations including both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, age estimation remains a challenging problem. In this paper, five cascaded structure frameworks are proposed for age estimation based on convolutional neural networks. All frameworks are learned and guided by auxiliary demographic information, since other demographic information (i.e., gender and race) is beneficial for age prediction. Each cascaded structure framework is embodied in a parent network and several subnetworks. For example, one of the applied framework is a gender classifier trained by gender information, and then two subnetworks are trained by the male and female samples, respectively. Furthermore, we use the features extracted from the cascaded structure frameworks with Gaussian process regression that can boost the performance further for age estimation. Experimental results on the MORPH II and CACD datasets have gained superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The mean absolute error is significantly reduced from 3.63 to 2.93 years under the same test protocol on the MORPH II dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Understanding music popularity is important not only for the artists who create and perform music but also for music-related industry. It has not been studied well how music popularity can be defined, what are its characteristics, and whether it can be predicted, which are addressed in this paper. We first define eight popularity metrics to cover multiple aspects of popularity. Then, analysis of each popularity metric is conducted with long-term real-world chart data to deeply understand the characteristics of music popularity in the real world. We also build classification models for predicting popularity metrics using acoustic data. In particular, we focus on evaluating features describing music complexity together with other conventional acoustic features including MPEG-7 and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features. Results show that, although there exists still room for improvement, it is feasible to predict the popularity metrics of a song significantly better than random chance based on its audio signal, particularly using both the complexity and MFCC features.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Since the launch of Google Glass in 2014, smart glasses have mainly been designed to support micro-interactions. The ultimate goal for them to become an augmented reality interface has not yet been attained due to an encumbrance of controls. Augmented reality involves superimposing interactive computer graphics images onto physical objects in the real world. This survey reviews current research issues in the area of human-computer interaction for smart glasses. The survey first studies the smart glasses available in the market and afterwards investigates the interaction methods proposed in the wide body of literature. The interaction methods can be classified into hand-held, touch, and touchless input. This paper mainly focuses on the touch and touchless input. Touch input can be further divided into on-device and on-body, while touchless input can be classified into hands-free and freehand. Next, we summarize the existing research efforts and trends, in which touch and touchless input are evaluated by a total of eight interaction goals. Finally, we discuss several key design challenges and the possibility of multi-modal input for smart glasses.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) therapy, the suitable amount of insulin dosage and the timings of its intake are needed for each individual patient to sustain a necessary blood glucose level for his/her body. In this article, a data stream mining approach is proposed to computationally derive real-time decision rules for formulating IDDM therapy, based on the insulin prescription records and the patient&amp;#x2019;s blood glucose reactions. Decision rules are based on latest health conditions that are continuously monitored from the patient instead of from a historical data archive of a population accumulated over years. Hence, the rules are adaptive and more accurately predict whether a medical implication will occur, given that glucose levels fluctuate under different medical effects, such as changes in lifestyle, type of medications or other external factors. A computer simulation experiment is conducted for evaluating the most suitable data stream algorithms with respect to accuracy and speed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Code smells are symptoms of poor design or implementation choices that have a negative effect on several aspects of software maintenance and evolution, such as program comprehension or change- and fault-proneness. This is why researchers have spent a lot of effort on devising methods that help developers to automatically detect them in source code. Almost all the techniques presented in literature are based on the analysis of structural properties extracted from source code, although alternative sources of information (e.g., textual analysis) for code smell detection have also been recently investigated. Nevertheless, some studies have indicated that code smells detected by existing tools based on the analysis of structural properties are generally ignored (and thus not refactored) by the developers. In this paper, we aim at understanding whether code smells detected using textual analysis are perceived and refactored by developers in the same or different way than code smells detected through structural analysis. To this aim, we set up two different experiments. We have first carried out a software repository mining study to analyze how developers act on textually or structurally detected code smells. Subsequently, we have conducted a user study with industrial developers and quality experts in order to qualitatively analyze how they perceive code smells identified using the two different sources of information. Results indicate that textually detected code smells are easier to identify and for this reason they are considered easier to refactor with respect to code smells detected using structural properties. On the other hand, the latter are often perceived as more severe, but more difficult to exactly identify and remove.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This study alters various exemplar presentation parameters to determine their effects on human online category learning for a future system that combines humans and computer vision (CV). Online category learning is necessary in this system because we envision that humans will need to provide input to assist CV modules in determining category labels without reducing throughput and without necessarily having expert knowledge of each category. In our study, subjects participated in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation paradigm in which they were asked to determine the target category from highlighted exemplar images interspersed among distractor images. In Experiment 1, the highlighting method was varied among four options and a negative (no-label) and positive (explicit, text-based) control. In Experiment 2, label accuracy was altered by incorrectly labeling some distractor and exemplar images. In both experiments, there were three levels of difficulty that varied the similarity between distractor and exemplar images. The results show that most highlighting methods resulted in equivalent accuracy to the positive control, but certain modalities were more effective at varying difficulty levels. In addition, the subject accuracy was sensitive to distractors highlighted as targets, but not to nonhighlighted exemplars. Our results indicate that human online category learning can be optimized for human&amp;#x2013;system interaction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Psychological studies have shown that personality traits are associated with preferences of book content. However, past findings are based on questionnaires focusing on conventional book genres and are unrepresentative of niche content. For a more comprehensive measure of book content, this study harnesses a massive archive of content labels, also known as &amp;#x2018;tags&amp;#x2019;, created by users of an online book catalogue, Goodreads.com. Combined with data on preferences and personality scores collected from Facebook users, the tag labels achieve high accuracy in personality prediction by psychological standards. We also group tags into broader genres, to check their validity against past findings. Our results are robust across both tag and genre levels of analyses, and consistent with existing literature. Moreover, user-generated tag labels reveal unexpected insights, such as cultural differences, book reading behaviors, and other non-content factors affecting preferences. To our knowledge, this is currently the largest study that explores the relationship between personality and book content preferences.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have recently emerged as a hot research area. However, the high mobility of LBSN users and the need to quickly provide access points in their interest zones present a unique research challenge. In order to address this challenge, in this paper, we consider the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to be a viable candidate to promptly form a wireless, meshed offloading backbone to support the LBSN data sensing and relevant data computations in the LBSN cloud. In the considered network, UAV-mounted cloudlets are assumed to carry out adaptive recommendation in a distributed manner so as to reduce computing and traffic load. Furthermore, the computational complexity and communication overhead of our proposed adaptive recommendation are analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed recommendation system in the considered LBSN is evaluated through computer-based simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposal achieves much improved performance compared to conventional methods in terms of accuracy, throughput, and delay.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Hand gesture is becoming an increasingly popular means of interacting with consumer electronic devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops. In this paper, we present AudioGest, a device-free gesture recognition system that can accurately sense the hand in-air movement around user&amp;#x0027;s devices. Compared to the state-of-the-art, AudioGest is superior in using only one pair of built-in speaker and microphone, without any extra hardware or infrastructure support and with no training, to achieve a multi-modal hand detection. Specifically, our system is not only able to accurately recognize various hand gestures, but also reliably estimate the hand in-air duration, average moving speed and waving range. We address various challenges including cleaning the noisy reflected sound signal, interpreting the echo spectrogram into hand gestures, decoding the Doppler frequency shifts into the hand waving speed and range, as well as being robust to the environmental motion and signal drifting. We extensively evaluate our system on three electronic deivces under four real-world scenarios using overall 3,900 hand gestures collected by five users for more than two weeks. Our results show that AudioGest detects six hand gestures with an accuracy up to 96%, and by distinguishing the gesture attributions, it can provide up to 162 control commands for various applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A significant amount of time is spent by software developers in investigating bug reports. It is useful to indicate when a bug report will be closed, since it would help software teams to prioritise their work. Several studies have been conducted to address this problem in the past decade. Most of these studies have used the frequency of occurrence of certain developer activities as input attributes in building their prediction models. However, these approaches tend to ignore the temporal nature of the occurrence of these activities. In this paper, a novel approach using Hidden Markov Models and temporal sequences of developer activities is proposed. The approach is empirically demonstrated in a case study using eight years of bug reports collected from the Firefox project. Our proposed model correctly identifies bug reports with expected bug fix times. We also compared our proposed approach with the state of the art technique in the literature in the context of our case study. Our approach results in approximately 33% higher F-measure than the contemporary technique based on the Firefox project data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Geotagging, the process of tagging of documents with geographical information, is an important issue in geographical information retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for geotagging of textual web documents. Existing techniques disambiguate place names occurring in a document individually first, and then find its focus. As opposed to this, the proposed approach, considers all the place names together without disambiguating them individually. It is a heuristic based three step process. The first step is hierarchical, the second one is geometric technique and last step reports the final focus. The approach requires only a gazetteer and a named entity recognition (NER) tool for processing. It reports the geographical focus of a web page as a tuple (latitude, longitude). We have tested our algorithm on two datasets, namely, theWikipedia and Open Directory Project (ODP) datasets. The proposed approach reports the focus correctly up to continent level for 97.07% of theWikipedia pages and correctly upto country level for 95.57% of them. Moreover, for more than 60% of the documents, the error in the distance between the actual focus and the reported focus is within 15 km i.e. less than 10 miles for this dataset. Additionally, the median error is 8.17 km. The technique also performs very well on huge datasets like ODP with sample size of around 600,000 web pages. The proposed system can be used in any geographic information retrieval system where geographic meta-data of documents needs to be obtained for indexing and searching.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In order to monitor the stability of industrial systems, engineers installed diversified sensors in systems, and used communication devices to transfer the sensed data to the cloud platform for real-time monitoring and event detection. Furthermore, as industry demand for power grows, the scale and quantity of power systems gradually increase, and the original network data transmission architecture cannot bear such large-scale communication, especially the communication bandwidth tolerance isn't allowed for trusted industrial internet of things. Therefore, this trusted transmission problem will be one of challenges of the industrial internet of things. In the application of device load recognition, how to create power fingerprinting recognition sample data, reduce the cloud platform computation complexity and the transmission quantity of sensed data without losing detection accuracy are the subjects of this study. Therefore, this study proposes a resilient section selection mechanism of power fingerprinting applied to device load recognition, in order to determine the transmission time and select the power fingerprinting section to be resiliently transferred, and replace the cycle-fixed full power fingerprinting data transfer for trusted industrial internet of things. According to the experimental results, in the case of multi-load, the power fingerprinting of the first 25% section have the maximum recognition of 87.5%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>If energy storage units are installed and operated in a coordinated manner, they can improve efficiency of the transmission and distribution systems. This paper presents a bilevel program to optimally site and size distributed energy storage units in the distribution system and to use them for both distribution and transmission system needs. The upper level of the bilevel program represents the operating objective and constraints of the distribution system, while the lower level accounts for the transmission perspective. The bilevel model is solved using the duality-based approach and its performance is tested on the IEEE transmission and distribution benchmarks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Network coding is a promising technology proven to improve the performance of wireless networks. To successfully design a quality-of-service (QoS)-satisfied routing protocol with network coding, the bandwidth consumption of a coding host should be determined. Furthermore, coding opportunities should be increased to improve network capacity. Nevertheless, it is challenging to determine whether a host can be a coding host and to determine the bandwidth consumption of a coding host in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). In this paper, we first present and define the coding conditions to identify a coding host. The bandwidth consumption of a coding host is then estimated under the contention-based wireless networks with a random access mechanism. Finally, we propose a bandwidth-satisfied and coding-aware multicast routing protocol (BCMRP). By taking into account the residual bandwidth of the carrier-sense neighbors of the forwarders, the proposed protocol can satisfy the bandwidth requirements of the requested flow and other ongoing flows. As a consequence of considering coding opportunities in multicast tree construction, the proposed multicast protocol can reduce the total bandwidth consumption. The simulation results show that BCMRP outperforms the prior multicast routing protocols in receiving ratio, admission ratio, and total bandwidth consumption.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Smart meters provide large amounts of data and the value of this data is getting increased attention because a better understanding of the characteristics of consumers helps utilities and retailers implement more effective demand response programs and more personalized services. This paper investigates how such characteristics can be inferred from fine-grained smart meter data. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) first automatically extracts features from massive load profiles. A support vector machine (SVM) then identifies the characteristics of the consumers. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art and advanced machine learning techniques are conducted. Case studies on an Irish dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep CNN-based method, which achieves higher accuracy in identifying the socio-demographic information about the consumers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Several variants of the subgraph isomorphism problem, e.g., finding, counting and estimating frequencies of subgraphs in networks arise in a number of real world applications, such as web analysis, disease diffusion prediction and social network analysis. These problems are computationally challenging in having to scale to very large networks with millions of vertices. In this paper, we present SAHAD, a MapReduce algorithm for detecting and counting trees of bounded size using the elegant color coding technique developed by N. Alon et al. SAHAD is a randomized algorithm, and we show rigorous bounds on the approximation quality and the performance of it. SAHAD scales to very large networks comprising of &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$10^{7}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;-&lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$10^{8}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; edges and tree-like (acyclic) templates with up to 12 vertices. Further, we extend our results by implementing SAHAD in the Harp framework, which is more of a high performance computing environment. The new implementation gives 100x improvement in performance over the standard Hadoop implementation and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art MPI solutions on larger graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>To meet the dynamic workload requirements in widespread task-batch based workflow applications, it is important to design algorithms for DAG-based platforms (such as Dryad, Spark and Pegasus) to rent virtual machines from public clouds dynamically. In terms of depths and functionalities, tasks of different task-batches are merged into task-units. A unit-aware deadline division method is investigated for properly dividing workflow deadlines to task deadlines so as to minimize the utilization of rented intervals. A rulebased task scheduling method is presented for allocating tasks to time slots of rented Virtual Machines (VMs) with a task right shifting operation and a weighted priority composite rule. A Unit-aware Rule-based Heuristic (URH) is proposed for elastically provisioning VMs to task-batch based workflows to minimize the rental cost in DAG-based cloud platforms. Effectiveness of the proposed URH methods is verified by comparing them against two adapted existing algorithms for similar problems on some realistic workflows.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Throughout many present studies dealing with multi-modal fusion, decisions are synchronously forced for fixed time segments across all modalities. Varying success is reported, sometimes performance is worse than unimodal classification. Our goal is the synergistic exploitation of multimodality whilst implementing a real-time system for affect recognition in a naturalistic setting. Therefore we present a categorization of possible fusion strategies for affect recognition on continuous time frames of complete recording sessions and we evaluate multiple implementations from resulting categories. These involve conventional fusion strategies as well as novel approaches that incorporate the asynchronous nature of observed modalities. Some of the latter algorithms consider temporal alignments between modalities and observed frames by applying asynchronous neural networks that use memory blocks to model temporal dependencies. Others use an indirect approach that introduces events as an intermediate layer to accumulate evidence for the target class through all modalities. Recognition results gained on a naturalistic conversational corpus show a drop in recognition accuracy when moving from unimodal classification to synchronous multimodal fusion. However, with our proposed asynchronous and event-based fusion techniques we are able to raise the recognition system&amp;#x2019;s accuracy by 7.83% compared to video analysis and 13.71% in comparison to common fusion strategies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A large plethora of models to predict human mobility exists in the literature. The problem of how to select the most appropriate model to solve a specific mobility prediction task has however received only little attention. Yet a wrong model choice may lead to severe performance losses. In this paper, we address the model selection problem in human mobility prediction and make the following contributions. We present SELECTOR, a generic framework to explore human mobility data and compute both population models and individual models to predict human mobility. The former are models that are adapted to the characteristics of an entire population of users and can be used to overcome the cold-start problem. The latter are prediction models optimized for individual users. We present and analyze the results obtainable using SELECTOR on the Nokia data set, which is one of the largest and richest, publicly available data sets of human mobility data. We show that for many users generic population models can be used in place of individual models with negligible performance losses. Yet for about 25% of the users individual models perform at least 3 percentage points better than population models. Thereby, we show that the use of phone context data does not lead to significantly better performance of human mobility predictors with respect to the case in which only temporal and spatial features are used. We further observe that the population models we derive are robust against the demographics of the users and that building different population models for different periods of the day leads to performance improvements. We make SELECTOR publicly available to allow other researchers and practitioners to explore further mobility data sets and to embed the code base of SELECTOR in their applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Varying types of shots is a fundamental element in the language of film, commonly used by a visual storytelling director. The technique is often used in creating professional recordings of a live concert, but meanwhile may not be appropriately applied in audience recordings of the same event. Such variations could cause the task of classifying shots in concert videos, professional or amateur, very challenging. To achieve more reliable shot classification, we propose a novel probabilistic-based approach, named as Coherent Classification Net (CC-Net), by addressing three crucial issues. First, We focus on learning more effective features by fusing the layer-wise outputs extracted from a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), pre-trained on a large-scale dataset for object recognition. Second, we introduce a frame-wise classification scheme, the error weighted deep cross-correlation model (EW-Deep-CCM), to boost the classification accuracy. Specifically, the deep neural network-based cross-correlation model (Deep-CCM) is constructed to not only model the extracted feature hierarchies of CNN independently but also relate the statistical dependencies of paired features from different layers. Then, a Bayesian error weighting scheme for classifier combination is adopted to explore the contributions from individual Deep-CCM classifiers to enhance the accuracy of shot classification in each image frame. Third, we feed the frame-wise classification results to a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) module to refine the shot predictions by taking account of the global and temporal regularities. We provide extensive experimental results on a dataset of live concert videos to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed CC-Net over existing popular fusion approaches for shot classification.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Information credibility on Twitter has been a topic of interest among researchers in the fields of both computer and social sciences, primarily because of the recent growth of this platform as a tool for information dissemination. Twitter has made it increasingly possible to offer near-real-time transfer of information in a very cost-effective manner. It is now being used as a source of news among a wide array of users around the globe. The beauty of this platform is that it delivers timely content in a tailored manner that makes it possible for users to obtain news regarding their topics of interest. Consequently, the development of techniques that can verify information obtained from Twitter has become a challenging and necessary task. In this paper, we propose a new credibility analysis system for assessing information credibility on Twitter to prevent the proliferation of fake or malicious information. The proposed system consists of four integrated components: a reputation-based component, a credibility classifier engine, a user experience component, and a feature-ranking algorithm. The components operate together in an algorithmic form to analyze and assess the credibility of Twitter tweets and users. We tested the performance of our system on two different datasets from 489,330 unique Twitter accounts. We applied 10-fold cross-validation over four machine learning algorithms. The results reveal that a significant balance between recall and precision was achieved for the tested dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many applications involve objects containing structure and rich content information, each describing different feature aspects of the object. Graph learning and classification is a common tool for handling such objects. To date, existing graph classification has been limited to the single-graph setting with each object being represented as one graph from a single structure-view. This inherently limits its use to the classification of complicated objects containing complex structures and uncertain labels. In this paper, we advance graph classification to handle multigraph learning for complicated objects from multiple structure views, where each object is represented as a bag containing several graphs and the label is only available for each graph bag but not individual graphs inside the bag. To learn such graph classification models, we propose a multistructure-view bag constrained learning (MSVBL) algorithm, which aims to explore substructure features across multiple structure views for learning. By enabling joint regularization across multiple structure views and enforcing labeling constraints at the bag and graph levels, MSVBL is able to discover the most effective substructure features across all structure views. Experiments and comparisons on real-world data sets validate and demonstrate the superior performance of MSVBL in representing complicated objects as multigraph for classification, e.g., MSVBL outperforms the state-of-the-art multiview graph classification and multiview multi-instance learning approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The wide spread use of social network services, especially location based services, has transformed social networks into an important information source of real-world events. Besides detecting real-world events, it is also desirable for government officials, news media, and police etc. to identify on-site users of an event, from whom we could gather valuable information regarding the process of events and investigate suspects when an event is associated with crime or terrorist. However, due to the high uncertainty of human mobility patterns and the low probability of users sharing their location information, it is difficult to identify on-site users while a social event unfolds, and research work in this area is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a Fused fEature Gaussian prOcess Regression (FEGOR) model, which exploits three influential factors in social networks for on-site user identification: mobility influence, content similarity, and social relationship. By integrating these factors, we are able to estimate the distance between a user and a social event even when the user&amp;#x0027;s location profile is unknown, thus identify on-site users. Experiments on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving a minimum mean absolute error of 1.7km and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, social media has become a popular channel for people to exchange opinions through the user-generated text. Exploring the mechanisms about how customers&amp;#x0027; opinions towards products are influenced by friends, and further predicting their future opinions have attracted great attention from corporate administrators and researchers. Various influence models have already been proposed for the opinion prediction problem. However, they largely formulate opinions as derived sentiment categories or values but ignore the role of the content information. Besides, existing models only make use of the most recently received information without taking into consideration the long-term historical communication. To keep track of user opinion behaviors and infer user opinion influence from the historical exchanged textual information, we develop a content-based sequential opinion influence framework. Based on this framework, two opinion sentiment prediction models with alternative prediction strategies are proposed. In the experiments conducted on three Twitter datasets, the proposed models outperform other popular influence models. An interesting finding based on a further analysis of user characteristic is that an individual&amp;#x0027;s influence is correlated to her/his style of expressions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Demographic information is usually treated as private data (e.g., gender and age), but has been shown great values in personalized services, advertisement, behavior study and other aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to make efficient demographic prediction based on smartphone application usage. Specifically, we firstly consider to characterize the data set by building a matrix to correlate users with types of categories from the log file of smartphone applications. Then, by considering the category-unbalance problem, we make use of the correlation between users&amp;#x2019; demographic information and their requested Internet resources to make the prediction, and propose an optimal method to further smooth the obtained results with category neighbors and user neighbors. The evaluation is supplemented by the dataset from real world workload. The results show advantages of the proposed prediction approach compared with baseline prediction. In particular, the proposed approach can achieve 81.21% of Accuracy in gender prediction. While in dealing with a more challenging multi-class problem, the proposed approach can still achieve good performance (e.g., 73.84% of Accuracy in the prediction of age group and 66.42% of Accuracy in the prediction of phone level).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Today, identity verification is required in many common activities, and it is arguably true that most people would like to be authenticated in the easiest and most transparent way, without having to remember a personal identification number. To this regard, this paper presents a multibiometric system based on the observation that the instinctive gesture of responding to a phone call can be used to capture two different biometrics, namely ear and arm gesture, which are complementary due to their, respectively, physical and behavioral nature. We conducted a comprehensive set of experiments aimed at assessing the contribution of each of the two biometrics as well as the advantage in their fusion to the system's overall performance. Experiments also provide objective measurement of both saliency and correlation of data captured by each sensor involved (accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera) according to various features extraction, features matching, and data-fusion techniques. The reports provide evidences about the potential of the proposed system and method for user authentication ``in-the-wild,' whilst its eventual usage for person identification is also investigated. All of the experiments have been carried out on a specifically built, publicly available ear-arm database, including multibiometric captures of more than 100 subjects performed during different sessions, that represents an additional contribution of this paper.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Quality of cloud service (QoS) is one of the crucial factors for the success of cloud providers in mobile cloud computing. Context-awareness is a popular method for automatic awareness of the mobile environment and choosing the most suitable cloud provider. Lack of context information may harm the users&amp;#x2019; confidence in the application rendering it useless. Thus, mobile devices need to be constantly aware of the environment and to test the performance of each cloud provider, which is inefficient and wastes energy. Crowdsourcing is a considerable technology to discover and select cloud services in order to provide intelligent, efficient, and stable discovering of services for mobile users based on group choice. This article introduces a crowdsourcing-based QoS supported mobile cloud service framework that fulfills mobile users&amp;#x2019; satisfaction by sensing their context information and providing appropriate services to each of the users. Based on user&amp;#x2019;s activity context, social context, service context, and device context, our framework dynamically adapts cloud service for the requests in different kinds of scenarios. The context-awareness based management approach efficiency achieves a reliable cloud service supported platform to supply the Quality of Service on mobile device.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly accepted the 2030 Development Agenda, which has included 92 paragraphs, and the Paragraph 91 defined 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets. The goal of this paper is to discover the correlations among SDGs and information and communications technologies (ICTs). This paper discusses the roles and opportunities that ICTs play in pursuing the SDGs. We identify a number of research gaps to those three pillars, social, economic, and environmental perspectives, of sustainable development. After extensive literature reviews on the SDG-related research initiatives and activities, we find that the majority of contributions to SDGs recognized by the IEEE and ACM research communities have mainly focused on the technical aspects while there are lack of the holistic social good perspectives. Therefore, there are essential and urgent needs to raise the awareness and call for attentions on how to innovate and energize ICTs in order to best assist all nations to achieve the SDGs by 2030.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Empirical results show that spatial factors such as distance, population density and communication range affect our social activities, also reflected by the development of ties in social networks. This motivates the need for social network models that take these spatial factors into account. Therefore, in this paper we propose a gravity-low-based geo-social network model, where connections develop according to the popularity of the individuals, but are constrained through their geographic distance and the surrounding population density. Specifically, we consider a power-law distributed popularity, and random node positions governed by a Poisson point process. We evaluate the characteristics of the emerging networks, considering the degree distribution, the average degree of neighbors and the local clustering coefficient. These local metrics reflect the robustness of the network, the information dissemination speed and the communication locality. We show that unless the communication range is strictly limited, the emerging networks are scale-free, with a rank exponent affected by the spatial factors. Even the average neighbor degree and the local clustering coefficient show tendencies known in non-geographic scale-free networks, at least when considering individuals with low popularity. At high-popularity values, however, the spatial constraints lead to popularity-independent average neighbor degrees and clustering coefficients.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Distributed line graphs were introduced by Zhang and Liu as an overlay for Peer-to-Peer networks. Distributed line graphs have some useful properties as a network topology, such as out-regular and small diameter, where the former implies that each user possesses a constant size of routing table and the latter means that a reasonably small number of hops is necessary to reach a target user. In this paper, we newly introduce distributed line sharp graphs, as an extension of distributed line graphs, so as to further expand the possibility of finding better network topologies and theoretically analyze their properties. The analysis on the distributed line sharp graphs is based on the analysis on distributed line graphs presented by Zhang and Liu. In particular, we further examine the diameter and the in-degree of a vertex, and improve the previous results together with detailed proofs. We also show that the diameter of a certain distributed line sharp graph is equal to the diameter of its corresponding distributed line graph.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Video-conferencing is becoming an essential part in everyday life. The visual channel allows for interactions which were not possible over audio-only communication systems such as the telephone. However, being a de-facto over-the-top service, the quality of the delivered video-conferencing experience is subject to variations, dependent on network conditions. Video-conferencing systems adapt to network conditions by changing for example encoding bitrate of the video. For this adaptation not to hamper the benefits related to the presence of a video channel in the communication, it needs to be optimized according to a measure of the Quality of Experience (QoE) as perceived by the user. The latter is highly dependent on the ongoing interaction and individual preferences, which have hardly been investigated so far. In this paper, we focus on the impact video quality has on conversations that revolve around objects that are presented over the video channel. To this end we conducted an empirical study where groups of 4 people collaboratively build a Lego&amp;#x00AE; model over a video-conferencing system. We examine the requirements for such a task by showing when the interaction, measured by visual and auditory cues, changes depending on the encoding bitrate and loss. We then explore the impact that prior experience with the technology and affective state have on QoE of participants. We use these factors to construct predictive models which double the accuracy compared to a model based on the system factors alone. We conclude with a discussion how these factors could be applied in real world scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Background: This study investigates linguistic characterizations in the form of linguistic co-occurrence patterns in discussion sections of English research articles (RAs) in an engineering discipline (i.e., chemical engineering) and linguistic variations that distinguish discussion sections of high-impact articles from those in low-impact articles. Research questions: 1. What underlying linguistic characterizations are salient in RA discussions in chemical engineering&amp;#x003F; 2. Are there any differences in the identified linguistic characterizations of discussion sections between high- and low-impact RAs&amp;#x003F; Literature review: In the process of composing RAs, the discussion section is a difficult and challenging part-genre to write. The rhetorical organization of RA discussions has been examined extensively through Swales&amp;#x0027;s English for Specific Purposes genre analysis. However, the linguistic characterizations of RA discussion sections remain unclear and the question of whether discernible differences exist between discussions of high- and low-impact RAs in a specialized engineering discipline remains unanswered. Methodology: This study used Biber&amp;#x0027;s multidimensional (MD) analysis method. In response to the first research question, factor analysis (in this study, principal component analysis) was adopted to identify the linguistic characterizations in the form of linguistic co-occurrence patterns (&amp;#x201C;dimensions&amp;#x201D;) in 213 RA discussion sections extracted from chemical engineering RAs. To answer the second question, the independent t-test was implemented to compare the high- and low-impact RA discussion sections in the identified dimensions. Results and conclusions: Six linguistic characterizations in the form of linguistic co-occurrence patterns were identified in RA discussion sections: 1. involvement and interactivity, 2. non-narration versus narration, 3. evaluat- ve statements with further explanations and elaborations, 4. informational density, 5. stating results&amp;#x002F;claims, and 6. expression of denial relationships toward statement or experimental findings. The results suggest the linguistic characterizations in RA discussion sections and interesting differences in the high- and low-impact RA discussion sections, especially in Dimensions 1, 3, and 5. Reasons for the linguistic variations in the identified dimensions are discussed, followed by the pedagogical implications for reading or writing RAs for international scientific communication.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper analyses call detail records of 16 million live calls over Internet-Protocol-based telecommunications networks. The objective is to examine the dependency between average call duration and call quality as perceived by the user. Surprisingly, the analysis suggests that the connection between quality and duration is non-monotonic. This contradicts the common assumption, that higher call quality leads to longer calls. In light of this new finding, the use of average call duration as indicator for (aggregated) user experience must be reconsidered. The results also impact modeling of user behavior. Based on the finding, such models must account for quality since user behavior is not fully inherent, but also depends on external factors like codec choice and network performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Phishing detection is recognized as a criminal issue of Internet security. By deploying a gateway anti-phishing in the networks, these current hardware-based approaches provide an additional layer of defense against phishing attacks. However, such hardware devices are expensive and inefficient in operation due to the diversity of phishing attacks. With promising technologies of virtualization in fog networks, an anti-phishing gateway can be implemented as software at the edge of the network and embedded robust machine learning techniques for phishing detection. In this paper, we use uniform resource locator (URL) features and web traffic features to detect phishing websites based on a designed neuro-fuzzy framework (dubbed Fi-NFN). Based on the new approach, fog computing as encouraged by Cisco, we design an anti-phishing model to transparently monitor and protect fog users from phishing attacks. The experiment results of our proposed approach, based on a large-scale dataset collected from real phishing cases, have shown that our system can effectively prevent phishing attacks and improve the security of the network.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems for risk evaluation of enterprise human capital investment with interval-valued bipolar 2-tuple linguistic numbers (IVB2TLNs). Then, we propose some arithmetic and geometric aggregation operators with IVB2TLNs and analysis the characteristics of these operators. Furthermore, we present methods that apply these operators to solve MADM problems with IVB2TLNs. Finally, a real-world example for risk evaluation of enterprise human capital investment is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The effect of transport-related pollution on human health is fast becoming recognized as a major issue in cities worldwide. Cyclists, in particular, face great health risks, as they typically are most exposed to tail-pipe emissions. Four avenues are being explored to combat urban air pollution: 1) policy interventions such as outright bans on polluting vehicles, 2) embracing zero tailpipe emission vehicles, 3) measuring air-quality as a means to better informing citizens of zones of higher pollution, and 4) developing smart mobility devices that seek to minimize the effect of polluting devices on citizens as they transport goods and individuals in our cities. Following this latter direction, in this paper, we present a new way to protect cyclists from the effect of urban pollution. Namely, by exploiting the actuation possibilities afforded by pedelecs or e-bikes (electric bikes), we design a cyber-physical system that mitigates the effect of urban pollution by indirectly controlling the ventilation rates (volume of air inhaled per minute) of cyclists in polluted areas. Results from a real device are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Aiming to solve the cluster lag consensus (CLC) problem of networked nonlinear agents with a switching topologies, this paper proposes a control algorithm based on the measurements of position and velocity. When the network has several clusters of agents, under the conditions that each cluster is a strongly connected digraph including isolated agents, and at least one agent in each cluster can communicate with the common leader each time, a sufficient condition is derived for reaching CLC. Finally, a numerical simulation is demonstrated to validate the proposed control algorithm and the developed conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The sparse problem of traffic volume data is unavoidable due to budget limits and device malfunctions in traffic systems. To address this problem, we propose a license plate recognition (LPR) data and collaborative tensor decomposition (CTD)-based method to estimate the sparse traffic volume data. The method works in two phases: first, a vehicle-time matrix is created based on LPR data, and non-negative matrix factorization is employed to analyze vehicle types; second, a road traffic volume tensor and the corresponding matrix of vehicle types are created, and people's check-in data and point of interest information are introduced to complement the sparse tensor with CTD. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional estimation methods, and it can estimate traffic volume data even when the missing rate is high.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A community in social networks is generally assumed to be composed of a group of individuals with similar characteristics. Although there has been a plethora of work on understanding network topologies (edge density, clustering coefficient, etc.) within a community, the semantic interpretation of a community has hardly been studied. The present paper aims at understanding whether individuals in a community possess similar Personalities, Values and Ethical backgrounds. To this end, we collect datasets from various social media platforms (including Facebook, Twitter), which contain Values and Ethics of users. Then we design a three-fold experimental setup. First, we propose automatic models to determine Personality and Values (Values and Ethics) of individuals by analyzing their language usage and behaviour in social media. Secondly, various experiments are performed to understand the characteristics or blend of characteristics of individuals within a community. Finally, we show that the detected Personality and Values of individuals can be used further as additional node attributes to detect better community structure. To our knowledge, this is the first computational analysis to understand and predict psycholinguistic dimensions of individuals in social networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cloud and Fog computing have established a convenient and widely adopted approach for computation offloading, where raw data generated by edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) context is collected and processed remotely. This vertical offloading pattern, however, typically does not take into account increasingly pressing time constraints of the emerging IoT scenarios, in which numerous data sources, including human agents (i.e. Social IoT), continuously generate large amounts of data to be processed in a timely manner. Big Data solutions could be applied in this respect, provided that networking issues and limitations related to connectivity of edge devices, are properly addressed. Although edge devices are traditionally considered to be resource-constrained, main limitations refer to energy, networking and memory capacities, whereas their ever-growing processing capabilities are already sufficient to be effectively involved in actual (Big Data) processing. In this context, the role of human agents is no longer limited to passive data generation, but can also include their voluntary involvement in relatively complex computations. This way, users can share their personal computational resources (i.e. mobile phones) to support collaborative data processing, thereby turning the existing IoT into a global cyber-physical-social system (CPSS). To this extent, this paper proposes a novel IoT/CPSS data processing pattern based on the Stream Processing technology, aiming to distribute the workload among a cluster of edge devices, involving mobile nodes shared by contributors on a voluntary basis, and paving the way for cluster computing at the Edge. Experiments on an Intelligent Surveillance System deployed on an edge device cluster demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, illustrating how its distributed in-memory data processing architecture can be effective.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Neurodegenerative diseases, as for instance Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), affect the peripheral nervous system, where nerve cells send the messages that control muscles in order to allow movements. Sick neurons cannot control muscles properly. Handwriting involves cognitive planning, coordination and execution abilities. Significant changes in the handwriting performance are a prominent feature of AD and PD. This work addresses the most relevant results obtained in the field of on-line (dynamic) analysis of handwritten trials by AD and PD patients. The survey is made from a pattern recognition point of view, so that different phases are described. Data acquisition deal not only with the device, but also with the handwriting task. Feature extraction can deal with function and parameter features. The classification problem is also discussed along with results already obtained. The paper also highlights the most profitable research direction.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Smart cyber-physical systems (S-CPSs) are complex engineered systems empowered by cyber-physical computing and equipped with the capability of reasoning, learning, adapting, and evolving. As an outcome of data-driven dynamic computing, reasoning capabilities, and the run-time obtained own knowledge, nonlinear and emergent behavior of S-CPSs whilst in operation is an open issue, not experienced in the case of conventional technical systems. This paper analyzes the technical issues of run-time operation and emergent behavior of S-CPSs, reviews the current understanding and state of advancement in designing S-CPSs for run-time, explores the paradox, and issues of designing for run-time adaptation, and synthesizes some general principles that can be taken into consideration when addressing the challenges, first of all, in the context of advanced manufacturing systems. This paper introduces four levels of CPSs according to reasoning capabilities and adaptation freedom of systems, and recognizes the paradox that a system with a higher level of freedom requires a higher level of self-control and resource management according to the overall objective of operation. Specific and common design principles are presented and critically assessed for each advancement level of CPSs. The principles synthesized by the authors provide only a partial fulfillment of the generic need. The planned future research addresses these issues and proposes (largely implementation and application independent) genuine principles for system developers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social recommender is an active research area. Most previous social recommenders adopt existing social networks to augment recommendations which are based on user preferences. In this contribution, we propose to simultaneously infer the social influence network and the user preferences in a matrix factorization framework. Furthermore, we assume that the influence strength is dependent on the social roles of users. We present an incremental clustering algorithm to detect dynamic social roles. Comprehensive experiments on real data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our model to generate precise recommendations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Early readmission prediction enables early intervention, which is essential to preventing serious or life-threatening events, and act as a substantial contributor to reduce healthcare costs. Existing works on predicting readmission often focus on certain vital signs and diseases by extracting statistical features. They also fail to consider skewness of class labels in medical data and different costs of misclassification errors. In this paper, we recur to the merits of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically learn features from time series of vital sign, and categorical feature embedding to effectively encode feature vectors with heterogeneous clinical features. Then, both learnt features via CNN and statistical features via feature embedding are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for prediction. We use a cost-sensitive formulation to train MLP during prediction to tackle the imbalance and skewness challenge. We validate the proposed approach on two real medical datasets from Barnes-Jewish Hospital. We find that early prediction of readmission is possible and when compared with state-of-the-art existing methods used by hospitals, our methods perform significantly better. Based on these results, a system is being deployed in hospital settings with the proposed forecasting algorithms to support treatment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Competitive accelerators can help startups overcome resource constraints and the liability of newness, but they are also highly selective when choosing startups. However, little is known about how a top accelerator selects startups and what the decision criteria are in that process. Here, we analyze a unique dataset of the real profiles of the startups that applied to the first seed accelerator in Southeast Asia and the accelerator&amp;#x0027;s decisions to uncover the selection process and latent criteria. We used a scoreboard of 30 criteria based on the real-win-worth (Is it real&amp;#x003F; Can it win&amp;#x003F; Is it worth doing&amp;#x003F;) framework to compare the profiles of the selected versus the rejected startups. Our analyses revealed that accelerator managers&amp;#x2019; implicit decision criteria shifted from eight real or win criteria in the initial screening of many startups to another four win or worth criteria in the final selection of a small number of startups. These critical criteria were further used to build regression models that predict screening and selection results. Understanding the shifting decision criteria may inform accelerator managers of their own subconscious preferences to improve the decision process, and as a result also increase entrepreneurs&amp;#x2019; empathy toward accelerator managers to sharpen their applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>O2O (online to offline) service recommendation is a typical context-aware service application, which needs to provide the most suitable services to customers in time according to their user profile and current context. By means of composing various data sources, different O2O service recommendation strategies can be customized, which may lead to great performance difference. Incorrect or non-real-time service recommendation would not work well and even cause negatives consequences. As a result, how to evaluate the performance of different O2O service recommendation strategies and select the most suitable one has become a key problem in the field. Due to the diversity and the variability of context events, as well as the economic, legal, and ethical impact, it is difficult or even impossible for traditional methods to realize comprehensive evaluation of various service strategies. Based on the background, this paper proposes a computational experiment-based evaluation method of O2O service recommendation strategies, which mainly consists of three parts: customization of O2O service strategies, modeling of experiment system, and execution of experiment evaluation. As a case study, the method was applied to Food O2O service. Three kinds of service strategies were compared respectively under two different market environments. Experiment results show that the proposed evaluation method is effective.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Contextual information plays an important role in visual recognition. This is especially true for action recognition as contextual information such as the objects a person interacts with and the scene in which the action is performed, is inseparable from a predefined action class. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism of humans shows remarkable capability compared with the existing computer vision system in discovering contextual information. Inspired by this, we applied the soft attention mechanism by adding two extra branches in the original VGG16 model in which one is to apply scene-level attention whilst the other is region-level attention to capture the global and local contextual information. To make the multi-branch model well converged and fully optimized, a two-step training method is proposed with an alternating optimization strategy. We call this model Multi-branch Attention Networks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two experimental settings: with and without the bounding box of the target person, three publicly available datasets on human action were used for evaluation. This method achieved state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC action dataset and the Stanford 40 dataset on both experimental settings and performed well on Humans Interacting with Common Objects (HICO) dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vision-based hand pose estimation is important in human-computer interaction. While many recent works focus on full degree-of-freedom hand pose estimation, robust estimation of global hand pose remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel algorithm to optimize the leaf weights in a Hough forest to assist global hand pose estimation with a single depth camera. Different from traditional Hough forest, we propose to learn the vote weights stored at the leaf nodes of a forest in a principled way to minimize average pose prediction error, so that ambiguous votes are largely suppressed during prediction fusion. Experiments show that the proposed method largely improves pose estimation accuracy with optimized leaf weights on both synthesis and real datasets and performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based methods. On real-world depth videos, the proposed method demonstrates improved robustness compared to several other recent hand tracking systems from both industry and academy. Moreover, we utilize the proposed method to build virtual/augmented reality applications to allow users to manipulate and examine virtual objects with bare hands.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we focus on event detection over the timeline of a music track. Such technology is motivated by the need for innovative applications such as searching, non-linearaccess and recommendation. Event detection over the timeline requires time-code level labels in order to train machine learning dels. We use timed comments from SoundCloud, a modern social music sharing platform, to obtain these labels. While in this way the need for tedious and time-consuming manual labeling can be reduced, the challenge is that timed comments are subject to additive temporal noise, as they are in the temporal neighborhood of the actual events. We investigate the utility of such noisy timed comments as training labels through a case study, in which we investigate three types of events in Electronic Dance Music (EDM): drop, build and break. These socially significant events play a key role in an EDM track&amp;#x0027;s unfolding and are popular in social media circles. They are therefore not only interesting for detection, but also typically accompanied by timed comments resulting from the online social activity around them. We propose a two-stage learning method that relies on noisy timed comments and, given a music track, marks the events on the timeline. In the experiments, we focus in particular on investigating to which extent noisy timed comments can replace manually added expert labels. The conclusions we draw during this study provide useful insights that motivates further research in the field of event detection.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cross-domain data analysis has been becoming more and more important, and can be effectively adopted for many applications. However, it is difficult to propose a unified crossdomain collaborative learning framework for cross domain analysis in social multimedia, because cross-domain data have multi-domain, multi-modal, sparse and supervised properties. In the paper, we propose a generic Cross-Domain Collaborative Learning (CDCL) framework via a discriminative nonparametric Bayesian dictionary learning model for cross-domain data analysis. Compared with existing cross-domain learning methods, our proposed model mainly has four advantages: (1) To address the domain discrepancy, we utilize the shared domain priors among multiple domains to make them share a common feature space. (2) To exploit the multi-modal property, we use the shared modality priors to model the relationship between different modalities. (3) To deal with the sparse property of media data in one domain, our goal is to learn a shared dictionary to bridge different domains and complement each other. (4) To make use of the supervised property, we exploit class label information to learn the shared discriminative dictionary, and utilize a latent probability vector to select different dictionary elements for representation of each class. Therefore, the proposed model can investigate the superiorities of different sources to supplement and improve each other effectively. In experiments, we have evaluated our model for two important applications including cross-platform event recognition and cross-network video recommendation. The experimental results have showed the effectiveness of our CDCL model for cross domain analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes a new general-purpose noreference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) method based on color texture analysis. Specifically, the proposed method uses the statistics of a orthogonal color planes pattern (OCPP) descriptor to characterize image quality. The OCPP descriptor, proposed in this paper, is an extension of the local binary pattern (LBP) operator that incorporates color information. To make NRIQA methods more generic, i.e. more sensitivity to different types of degradation (e.g. color and contrast degradation), it is important to take into consideration the color information. In the proposed NR-IQA method, we use the statistics of the OCPP descriptor as input vector to a regression algorithm, which models the nonlinear relationship between the OCPP statistics and the subjective opinion scores. Experimental results show that proposed IQA method is quite efficient when compared to popular state-of-the-art NR-IQA methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vehicular content networks (VCNs), which distribute medium-volume contents to vehicles in a fully distributed manner, represent the key enabling technology of vehicular infotainment applications. In VCNs, the road-side units (RSUs) cache replicas of contents on the edge of networks to facilitate the timely content delivery to driving-through vehicles when requested. However, due to the limited storage at RSUs and soaring content size for distribution, RSUs can only selectively cache content replicas. The edge caching scheme in RSUs therefore become a fundamental issue in VCNs. This paper addresses the issue by developing an edge caching scheme in RSUs. Specifically, we first analyze the features of vehicular content requests based on the content access pattern, vehicle's velocity, and road traffic density. A model is then proposed to determine whether and where to obtain the replica of content when the moving vehicle requests it. A cross entropy based scheme is proposed accordingly to cache the efficient content at the edge of VCNs. Lastly, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by extensive simulation experiments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This article provides insight into the transformative role social media may play in informal knowledge sharing in an enterprise by adopting a social capital perspective. This work explores the ways in which the use of social media results in digital transformation of informal ties that provide the social capital needed for knowledge sharing within and across organizations. The effects of social media on social ties are captured by drawing upon a field study of social media adoption by consultants.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper studies linear-quadratic (LQ) mean-field-game (MFG) for a class of stochastic delayed systems. We consider a large-population system where the dynamics of each agent is modeled by a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE). The consistency condition is derived through an auxiliary system which is an anticipated forward-backward stochastic differential equation with delay (AFBSDDE). The wellposedness of such AFBSDDE system can be obtained using continuation method. Thus, the MFG strategies can be defined on an arbitrary time-horizon, not necessary on small time-horizon by common-used contraction mapping method. Moreover, the decentralized strategies are verified to satisfy &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$epsilon$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;-Nash equilibrium property. For illustration, two special cases of delayed systems are further explored for which the closed- and open-loop MFG strategies are derived respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The goal of a biometric recognition system is to make a human-like decisions on individual's identity by recognizing their physiological and/or behavioral traits. Nevertheless, the decision-making process by either a human or a biometric recognition system can be highly complicated due to low quality of data or an uncertain environment. Human brain has an advantage over computer system due to its ability to perform a massive parallel processing of auxiliary information, such as visual cues, cognitive and social interactions, contextual, and spatio-temporal data. Similarly to a human brain, social behavioral cues can aid the reliable decision-making of an automated biometric system. In this paper, a novel person recognition approach is presented, that relies on the knowledge of individuals' social behavior to enhance the performance of a traditional biometric system. The social behavioral information of individuals' has been mined from an online social network and fused with traditional face and ear biometrics. Experimental results on individual's and semi-real databases demonstrate significant performance gain in the proposed method over traditional biometric system.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Hundreds of thousands of people from different physical locations can join virtual worlds whenever they want to interact with each other and create objects in a computer-based simulated environment, typically in an interactive 3D format. The rich social media data generated in virtual worlds has important implications for business, education, social science, and society at large. However, how to collect such social media data is a relatively unexplored topic and remains an issue. In this study, we developed an integrated framework combining both bot-based and spider-based approaches to collect avatar behavioral and profile data. Following the proposed framework, we conducted a case study to examine avatar action differences between the two genders as well as between young-aged and old-aged avatars. The results of the case study indicated that in general male avatars tended to perform more active physical actions than female avatars, and young-aged avatars tended to perform more active physical actions than old-aged avatars.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks is of paramount importance for understanding and controlling the spreading dynamics. A challenging and yet inadequately explored task is to detect such influential nodes in multilayer networks, i.e., networks that encompass different types of connections (e.g., different relationships) among the nodes, hence facilitating a multilayer structure. Our purpose is to devise a method that can accurately detect nodes able to exert strong influence over the multilayer network; the method will be based solely on local knowledge of a network&amp;#x0027;s topology in order to be fast and scalable due to the huge size of the network, and thus suitable for both real-time applications and offline mining. Based on our belief that a strong influencer is a node positioned in a well-connected neighborhood, we propose a series of methods which capture in a single number the rich inter- and intra-layer connectivity of the node. Our simulations showed that the proposed measures can detect effective spreaders in both real and synthetic networks, under various settings and against various competitors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The medical crowdsourced question answering (Q&amp;A) websites are booming in recent years, and increasingly large amount of patients and doctors are involved. The valuable information from these medical crowdsourced Q&amp;A websites can benefit patients, doctors and the society. One key to unleash the power of these Q&amp;A websites is to extract medical knowledge from the noisy question-answer pairs and filter out unrelated or even incorrect information. Facing the daunting scale of information generated on medical Q&amp;A websites everyday, it is unrealistic to fulfill this task via supervised method due to the expensive annotation cost. In this paper, we propose a Medical Knowledge Extraction (MKE) system that can automatically provide high quality knowledge triples extracted from the noisy question-answer pairs, and at the same time, estimate expertise for the doctors who give answers on these Q&amp;A websites. The MKE system is built upon a truth discovery framework, where we jointly estimate trustworthiness of answers and doctor expertise from the data without any supervision. We further tackle three unique challenges in the medical knowledge extraction task, namely representation of noisy input, multiple linked truths, and the long-tail phenomenon in the data. The MKE system is applied on real-world datasets crawled from xywy.com, one of the most popular medical crowdsourced Q&amp;A websites. Both quantitative evaluation and case studies demonstrate that the proposed MKE system can successfully provide useful medical knowledge and accurate doctor expertise. We further demonstrate a real-world application, Ask A Doctor, which can automatically give patients suggestions to their questions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In most metaheuristic algorithms, the updating process fails to make use of information available from individuals in previous iterations. If this useful information could be exploited fully and used in the later optimization process, the quality of the succeeding solutions would be improved significantly. This paper presents our method for reusing the valuable information available from previous individuals to guide later search. In our approach, previous useful information was fed back to the updating process. We proposed six information feedback models. In these models, individuals from previous iterations were selected in either a fixed or random manner. Their useful information was incorporated into the updating process. Accordingly, an individual at the current iteration was updated based on the basic algorithm plus some selected previous individuals by using a simple fitness weighting method. By incorporating six different information feedback models into ten metaheuristic algorithms, this approach provided a number of variants of the basic algorithms. We demonstrated experimentally that the variants outperformed the basic algorithms significantly on 14 standard test functions and 10 CEC 2011 real world problems, thereby, establishing the value of the information feedback models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Messages posted to social media in the aftermath of a natural disaster are not only useful for detecting the event itself. More importantly, mining such deliberately dropped digital traces allows a precise situational awareness, from which disaster's consequences on population and infrastructures can be timely estimated. Yet, to date, the automatic assessment of damage has received little attention. Here, the authors explore feeding predictive models by tweets conveying on-the-ground social sensors observations to nowcast the perceived intensity of earthquakes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Incremental learning with concept drift has often been tackled by ensemble methods, where models built in the past can be retrained to attain new models for the current data. Two design questions need to be addressed in developing ensemble methods for incremental learning with concept drift, i.e., which historical (i.e., previously trained) models should be preserved and how to utilize them. A novel ensemble learning method, namely, Diversity and Transfer-based Ensemble Learning (DTEL), is proposed in this paper. Given newly arrived data, DTEL uses each preserved historical model as an initial model and further trains it with the new data via transfer learning. Furthermore, DTEL preserves a diverse set of historical models, rather than a set of historical models that are merely accurate in terms of classification accuracy. Empirical studies on 15 synthetic data streams and 5 real-world data streams (all with concept drifts) demonstrate that DTEL can handle concept drift more effectively than 4 other state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Packet routing is important for vehicular delay tolerant networks (VDTNs). Opportunistic routing algorithms based on historical records are insufficiently accurate in forwarder selection due to movement randomness of vehicles. Trajectory-based routing algorithms tackle vehicle movement randomness but cannot be directly used in VDTNs due to the dependence on APs. In this paper, we develop a distributed trajectory-based routing algorithm (called MobiT) for VDTNs. This non-trivial task faces three challenges. First, vehicle trajectories must be sufficiently collected. Second, the trajectories cannot be updated frequently due to limited resources of the repository nodes. Third, achieving high routing performance even with partially collected trajectories. Our real trace study lays the foundation of the design of MobiT. Taking advantage of different roles of vehicles, MobiT uses service vehicles that move in wide areas to collect vehicle trajectories, and rely on the service vehicles and roadside units (called schedulers) for routing scheduling. By using regular temporal congestion state of road segments, MobiT schedules the packet to arrive at a roadside unit prior to the destination vehicle to improve routing performance. Furthermore, MobiT leverages vehicles' long-term mobility patterns to assist routing. Our trace-driven simulation and real experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of MobiT.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The exponential growth of big data places a great burden on current computing environment. However, there exists a vast gap in the approaches that can securely and efficiently process the large scale heterogeneous data. This paper, on the basis of transparent computing paradigm, presents a unified approach that coordinates the transparent servers and transparent clients to decompose tensor, a mathematical model widely used in data intensive applications, to a core tensor multiplied with a number of truncated orthogonal bases. The structured, semi-structured as well as unstructured data are transformed to low-order sub-tensors, which are then encrypted using the Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme on the transparent clients. The cipher sub-tensors are transported to the transparent servers for carrying out the integration and decomposition operations. Three secure decomposition algorithms, namely secure bidiagonalization algorithm, secure singular value decomposition algorithm, and secure mode product algorithm, are presented to generate the bidiagonal matrices, truncated orthogonal bases, and core tensor respectively. The homomorphic operations of the three algorithms are carried out on the transparent servers, while the non-homomorphic operations, namely division and square root, are performed on the transparent clients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is promising for secure tensor decomposition for big data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Over the past few decades, many studies conducted in the field of learning science have described that scaffolding plays an important role in human learning. To scaffold a learner efficiently, a teacher should predict how much support a learner must have to complete tasks and then decide the optimal degree of assistance to support the learner&amp;#x0027;s development. Nevertheless, it is difficult to ascertain the optimal degree of assistance for learner development. For this study, it is assumed that optimal scaffolding is based on a probabilistic decision rule: given a teacher&amp;#x0027;s assistance to facilitate the learner development, an optimal probability exists for a learner to solve a task. To ascertain that optimal probability, we developed a scaffolding system that provides adaptive hints to adjust the predictive probability of the learner&amp;#x0027;s successful performance to the previously determined certain value, using a probabilistic model, i.e., item response theory (IRT). Furthermore, using the scaffolding system, we compared learning performances by changing the predictive probability. Results show that scaffolding to achieve 0.5 learner success probability provides the best performance. Additionally, results demonstrate that a scaffolding system providing 0.5 probability decreases the number of hints (amount of support) automatically as a fading function according to the learner&amp;#x0027;s growth capability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the popularity of wearable devices, along with the development of clouds and cloudlet technology, there has been increasing need to provide better medical care. The processing chain of medical data mainly includes data collection, data storage and data sharing, etc. Traditional healthcare system often requires the delivery of medical data to the cloud, which involves users&amp;#x2019; sensitive information and causes communication energy consumption. Practically, medical data sharing is a critical and challenging issue. Thus in this paper, we build up a novel healthcare system by utilizing the flexibility of cloudlet. The functions of cloudlet include privacy protection, data sharing and intrusion detection. In the stage of data collection, we first utilize Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) method to encrypt user&amp;#x2019;s body data collected by wearable devices. Those data will be transmitted to nearby cloudlet in an energy efficient fashion. Secondly, we present a new trust model to help users to select trustable partners who want to share stored data in the cloudlet. The trust model also helps similar patients to communicate with each other about their diseases. Thirdly, we divide users&amp;#x2019; medical data stored in remote cloud of hospital into three parts, and give them proper protection. Finally, in order to protect the healthcare system from malicious attacks, we develop a novel collaborative intrusion detection system (IDS) method based on cloudlet mesh, which can effectively prevent the remote healthcare big data cloud from attacks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapidly increasing computing demand, data centers become more and more power-hungry. Meanwhile, due to the time-dependent demand preference, power grid is suffering high load variations. In this paper, we consider a cost-efficient workload scheduling with a coordination between a cloud service provider operating multiple geo-distributed data centers and smart grids. The aim is to explore the flexibility of data center power demands to reduce the cost of the cloud service provider and smooth the load variations of smart grids simultaneously. We first present the penalty model of the computation workload scheduling at each data center, and introduce the cost model of smart grids. We formulate the objective function as a weighted sum of the cost and the penalty to study the tradeoffs, and obtain the optimal offline solution by the dual decomposition technique. Furthermore, we propose a Receding Horizon Control (RHC) based online algorithm to obtain the suboptimal workload management based on the predicted information. The simulation results show that with the coordination between the cloud service provider and smart grids, the cost of smart grids can be significantly reduced, by up to 20%, and the load variations of smart grids can be well smoothed simultaneously.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we aim at tackling the problem of user clustering in the context of their published short text streams. Clustering users by short text streams is more challenging than in the case of long documents associated with them as it is difficult to track users&amp;#x0027; dynamic interests in streaming sparse data. To obtain better performance, we propose two user collaborative interest tracking models (UCIT) that aim at tracking changes of each user&amp;#x0027;s dynamic topic distributions in collaboration with their followees&amp;#x0027; dynamic topic distributions, based both on the content of current texts and the previously estimated distributions. UCIT models can be either short-tern or long-term dependency topic models. Short-term dependency model collaboratively tracks users&amp;#x0027; interests based on users&amp;#x0027; topic distributions at the previous time period only, whereas long-term dependency model collaboratively tracks users&amp;#x0027; interests based on users&amp;#x0027; topic distributions at multiple time periods. We also propose two collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithms for collaboratively inferring users&amp;#x0027; dynamic interests in our short-term and long-term dependency topic models, respectively. We evaluate our proposed models via a benchmark dataset. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our UCIT models that integrate both users&amp;#x0027; and their collaborative interests for user clustering by short text streams.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The recent development of big data-oriented wireless technologies in terms of emerging 5G, edge computing, interconnected devices of the Internet of things (IoT), and data analytics, as well as techniques, have enabled connected healthcare services for a happier and healthier life. Although the quality of the healthcare services can be enhanced through big data-oriented wireless technologies, however, the challenges remain for not considering emotional care, especially for children, elderly, and mentally ill people. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware connected healthcare system using a powerful emotion detection module. Different IoT devices are used to capture speech and image signals of a patient in a smart home scenario. These signals are used as the input to the emotion detection module. Speech and image signals are processed separately, and classification scores using these signals are fused to produce a final score to take a decision about the emotion. If the emotion is detected as pain, caregivers can visit the patient. Several experiments were performed to validate the proposed system, and good accuracies, up to 99.87%, were achieved for emotion detection. The proposed framework would greatly contribute personalized and seamless emotion-aware healthcare services towards 5G.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have received an increasing attention to understand how genetic variation affects different human traits. In this paper, we study whether and to what extend exploiting the GWAS statistics can be used for inferring private information about a human individual. We first provide a method to construct a three-layered Bayesian network explicitly revealing the conditional dependency between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits from public GWAS catalog. The key challenge in building a Bayesian network from GWAS statistics is the specification of the conditional probability table of a variable with multiple parent variables. We employ the models of independence of causal influences which assume that the causal mechanism of each parent variable is mutually independent. We then formulate three inference problems based on the dependency relationship captured in the Bayesian network, namely trait inference given SNP genotype, genotype inference given trait, and trait inference given known traits, and develop efficient formulas and algorithms. Different from previous work, the possible target of these inference problems we study may be any individual, not limited to GWAS participants. Empirical evaluations show the effectiveness of our proposed methods. In summary, our work implies that meaningful information can be inferred from modeling GWAS statistics, and appropriate privacy protection mechanisms need to be developed to protect genetic privacy not only of GWAS participants but also regular individuals.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a collaborative route discovery method that leverages the experience and preferences of taxi drivers in urban areas. The proposed method is mainly comprised of two phases: collaborative preference discovery (CPD) and intelligent driver network generation (IDNG). In the first phase, given an origin-destination (O-D) pair and provided that the cluster is a road segment set within a time-reachable range, we propose CPD which involves cluster-to-cluster retrieval to capture the top-k routes that are not only frequently traversed by taxis but also neighboring to the O-D pair. In the second phase, to support route computation, an IDNG algorithm is devised to generate an experiential graph for each specific O-D pair. In empirical studies, using the period-based experiential route database, sensitivity analysis is employed to select optimal parameters of intelligent driver networks. The results demonstrate that the routes recommended by our collaborative method are much more reliable than those of the shortest-path method with respect to the variance of travel time. Moreover, the recommended routes are traversed more frequently than those of the fastest-path and the shortest-path methods, while the travel time and route lengths of our routes are approximately equal to those of the conventional methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Complex Big Data systems in modern organisations are progressively becoming attack targets by existing and emerging threat agents. Elaborate and specialised attacks will increasingly be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses. With the ever-increasing trend of cybercrime and incidents due to these vulnerabilities, effective vulnerability management is imperative for modern organisations regardless of their size. However, organisations struggle to manage the sheer volume of vulnerabilities discovered on their networks. Moreover, vulnerability management tends to be more reactive in practice. Rigorous statistical models, simulating anticipated volume and dependence of vulnerability disclosures, will undoubtedly provide important insights to organisations and help them become more proactive in the management of cyber risks. By leveraging the rich yet complex historical vulnerability data, our proposed novel and rigorous framework has enabled this new capability. By utilising this sound framework, we initiated an important study on not only handling persistent volatilities in the data but also further unveiling multivariate dependence structure amongst different vulnerability risks. In sharp contrast to the existing studies on univariate time series, we consider the more general multivariate case striving to capture their intriguing relationships. Through our extensive empirical studies using the real world vulnerability data, we have shown that a composite model can effectively capture and preserve long-term dependency between different vulnerability and exploit disclosures. In addition, the paper paves the way for further study on the stochastic perspective of vulnerability proliferation towards building more accurate measures for better cyber risk management as a whole.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In a semi-supervised learning scenario, (possibly noisy) partially observed labels are used as input to train a classifier, in order to assign labels to unclassified samples. In this paper, we construct a complete graph-based binary classifier given only samples' feature vectors and partial labels. Specifically, we first build appropriate similarity graphs with positive and negative edge weights connecting all samples based on inter-node feature distances. By viewing a binary classifier as a piecewise constant graph-signal, we cast classifier learning as a signal restoration problem via a classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. One unfortunate consequence of negative edge weights is that the graph Laplacian matrix &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$L$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; can be indefinite, and previously proposed graph-signal smoothness prior &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$x^{T} L x$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; for candidate signal &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$x$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; can lead to pathological solutions. In response, we derive a minimum-norm perturbation matrix &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$Del$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; that preserves &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$L$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;'s eigen-structure---based on a fast lower-bound computation of &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$L$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;'s smallest negative eigenvalue via a novel application of the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula---so that &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$L + Del$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; is positive semi-definite, resulting in a stable signal prior. Further, instead of forcing a hard binary decision for each sample, we define the notion of generalized smoothness on graphs that promotes ambiguity in the classifier signal. Finally, we propose an algorithm based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) that solves the posed MAP problem efficiently. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms both SVM variants and previous graph-based classifiers using positive-edge graphs noticeably.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The topic of stress is nowadays a very important one, not only in research but on social life in general. People are increasingly aware of this problem and its consequences at several levels: health, social life, work, quality of life, etc. This resulted in a significant increase in the search for devices and applications to measure and manage stress in real-time. Recent technological and scientific evolution fosters this interest with the development of new methods and approaches. In this paper we survey these new methods for stress assessment, focusing especially on those that are suited for the workplace: one of today&amp;#x2019;s major sources of stress. We contrast them with more traditional methods and compare them between themselves, evaluating nine characteristics. Given the diversity of methods that exist nowadays, this work facilitates the stakeholders&amp;#x2019; decision towards which one to use, based on how much their organization values aspects such as privacy, accuracy, cost-effectiveness or intrusiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Understanding and profiling player motivation complements and extends research on gameflow, player profiling and game artificial intelligence, which helps us design entertaining games. However, automated identification of a player&amp;#x2019;s motive profile remains an open challenge. An emerging technology that shows promise as a novel technique for identifying cognitive phenomena is electroencephalography. This paper begins with a survey of literature applying electroencephalography to measure cognitive characteristics relevant to player motivation types. Then we present conceptual models that link motivation theory to mental states that can be identified using electroencephalography including emotion, risk-taking and social attitudes. We conclude the paper by examining the research challenges associated with using electroencephalography to validate these models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We explore the concept of abstraction as it is used in visualization, with the ultimate goal of understanding and formally defining it. Researchers so far have used the concept of abstraction largely by intuition without a precise meaning. This lack of specificity left questions on the characteristics of abstraction, its variants, its control, or its ultimate potential for visualization and, in particular, illustrative visualization mostly unanswered. In this paper we thus provide a first formalization of the abstraction concept and discuss how this formalization affects the application of abstraction in a variety of visualization scenarios. Based on this discussion, we derive a number of open questions still waiting to be answered, thus formulating a research agenda for the use of abstraction for the visual representation and exploration of data. This paper, therefore, is intended to provide a contribution to the discussion of the theoretical foundations of our field, rather than attempting to provide a completed and final theory.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The goal of transfer learning is to improve the performance of target learning task by leveraging information (or transferring knowledge) from other related tasks. In this paper, we examine the problem of transfer distance metric learning (DML), which usually aims to mitigate the label information deficiency issue in the target DML. Most of the current Transfer DML (TDML) methods are not applicable to the scenario where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Some existing heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL) approaches can learn target distance metric by usually transforming the samples of source and target domain into a common subspace. However, these approaches lack flexibility in real-world applications, and the learned transformations are often restricted to be linear. This motivates us to develop a general flexible heterogeneous TDML (HTDML) framework. In particular, any (linear/nonlinear) DML algorithms can be employed to learn the source metric beforehand. Then the pre-learned source metric is represented as a set of knowledge fragments to help target metric learning. We show how generalization error in the target domain could be reduced using the proposed transfer strategy, and develop novel algorithm to learn either linear or nonlinear target metric. Extensive experiments on various applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Web advertising related to Human Trafficking (HT) activity has been on the rise in recent years. Answering entity-centric questions over crawled HT Web corpora to assist investigators in the real world is an important social problem, involving many technical challenges. This paper describes a recent entity-centric knowledge graph effort that resulted in a semantic search engine to assist analysts and investigative experts in the HT domain. The overall approach takes as input a large corpus of advertisements crawled from the Web, structures it into an indexed knowledge graph, and enables investigators to satisfy their information needs by posing investigative search queries to a special-purpose semantic execution engine. We evaluated the search engine on real-world data collected from over 90,000 webpages, a significant fraction of which correlates with HT activity. Performance on four relevant categories of questions on a mean average precision metric were found to be promising, outperforming a learning-to-rank approach on three of the four categories. The prototype uses open-source components and scales to terabyte-scale corpora. Principles of the prototype have also been independently replicated, with similarly successful results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The number of issues fixed in the current release of the software is one of the factors which decides the next release of the software. The source code files get changed during fixing of these issues. The uncertainty arises due to these changes is quantified using entropy based measures. We developed a Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process model for Open Source Software to understand the fixing of issues across releases. Based on this model, optimal release-updating using entropy and maximizing the active user&amp;#x0027;s satisfaction level subject to fixing of issues up to a desired level, is investigated as well. The proposed models have been validated on five products of the Apache open source project. The optimal release time estimated from the proposed model is close to the observed release time at different active user&amp;#x0027;s satisfaction levels. The proposed decision model can assist management to appropriately determine the optimal release-update time. The proposed entropy based model, for issues estimation shows improvement in performance for 21 releases out of total 23 releases, when compared with well-known traditional software reliability growth models, namely GO model [1] and S-shaped model [2]. The proposed model is also found statistically significant.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The video highlight detection task is to localize key elements (moments of user's major or special interest) in a video. Most of existing highlight detection approaches extract features from the video segment as a whole without considering the difference of local features both temporally and spatially. Due to the complexity of video content, this kind of mixed features will impact the final highlight prediction. In temporal extent, not all frames are worth watching because some of them only contain background of the environment without human or other moving objects. In spatial extent, it is similar that not all regions in each frame are highlights especially when there are lots of clutters in the background. To solve the above problem, we propose a novel 3D (spatial+temporal) attention model which can automatically localize the key elements in a video without any extra supervised annotations. Specifically, the proposed attention model produces attention weights of local regions along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the video segment. The regions of key elements in the video will be strengthened with large weights. Thus more effective feature of the video segment is obtained to predict the highlight score. The proposed 3D attention scheme can be easily integrated into a conventional end-to-end deep ranking model which aims to learn a deep neural network to compute the highlight score of each video segment. Extensive experimental results on the YouTube and SumMe datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods. With the proposed 3D attention model, video highlights can be accurately retrieved in spatial and temporal dimensions without human supervision in several domains, such as gymnastics, parkour, skating, skiing, surfing and dog activities, on the public datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many real-world data can be represented as attributed graphs that contain vertices each of which is associated with a set of attribute values. Discovering clusters, or communities, which are structural patterns in these graphs is one of the most important tasks in graph analysis. To perform the task, a number of algorithms have been proposed. Some of them detect clusters of particular topological properties whereas some others discover them based mainly on attribute information. Also, most algorithms discover disjoint clusters only. As a result, they may not be able to detect more meaningful clusters hidden in the attributed graph. To do so more effectively, we propose an algorithm, called FSPGA, to discover fuzzy structural patterns for graph analytics. FSPGA performs the task of clusters discovery as a fuzzy constrained optimization problem which takes into consideration both graph topology and attribute values. FSPGA has been tested with both synthetic and real-world graph data sets and is found to be efficient and effective at detecting clusters in attributed graphs. FSPGA is a promising fuzzy algorithm for structural pattern detection in attributed graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a weakly supervised regression model for visual house appraisal problem, which aims to predict the value of a house from its photos and textual descriptions (e.g., number of bedrooms). The key idea of our approach is a multi-layer neural network, called multi-instance Deep Ranking and Regression (MiDRR) net, which jointly solves two coupled tasks: ranking and regression, in the multiple instance setting. The network is trained using weakly supervised data, which do not require intensive human annotations. We also design a set of human heuristics to promote deep features through imposing constraints over the solution space, e.g., a house with &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$3$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; bedrooms often has higher value than that with only &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$2$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; bedrooms. While these constraints are specific to the studied problem, the developed formula can be easily generalized to the other regression applications. For test and evaluation purposes, we collect a comprehensive house image benchmark that includes &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$900,000$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; photos from &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$30,000$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; houses recently traded in U.S.A., and apply the proposed MiDRR net to predict house values. Extensive evaluations with comparisons demonstrate that additional usage of imagery data as well as human heuristics can significantly boost system performance and that the proposed MiDRR net clearly outperforms the alternative methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Understanding changes in climate extremes is an urgent challenge in the study of climate change. We show how to apply topic modeling techniques from natural language processing, to learn climate patterns from data. Via topic modeling, we extracted global climate patterns from multivariate climate data, while respecting the diversity in expressing climate extremes on the regional level. Specifically, we modeled relations between climate variables via latent topics and found the probability of each climate topic appearing at different geographical locations. Preliminary experimental results showed evidence of this method capturing a major historical drought.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper addresses the problem of geotagging images, i.e., assigning GPS coordinates (i.e., latitude, longitude) to images using image contents. Due to the huge appearance variability of visual features across the world, image content and their GPS coordinates may be inconsistent. This means images captured from geographically close areas may appear visually distinct; and images of visually similar content may be taken from geographically distant areas. In this paper, we propose a deep geo-constrained auto-encoder (DGAE) to solve the inconsistency problems. Using clustered GPS data and image data, our approach identifies inconsistent (image, GPS) data pairs. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that can learn similar feature representations for geographically close images and distinct feature representation for geographically distant images. We introduce two new constraints, the same-area constraint and the easy-confusing constraint to our feature learning networks. The former one penalizes images from the same area but with very distinct visual features and the latter one penalizes images from distant areas but with very similar visual features. A deep architecture is developed to further improve learning discriminative features that can disambiguate different geometric locations. Our approach is extensively evaluated on a newly-compiled large dataset and outperforms comparison approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Semi-supervised DR techniques via virtual label regression (LRDR techniques), such as, LapRLS, FME and VLR, recently have attracted much attention since they are more effective but more efficient compared to those traditional DR methods which are to solve an eigenvalue problem, respectively. However, it suffers from two restrictions. In order to address this issue, this paper develops an effective regression framework of semi-supervised dimension reduction though label propagation and label regression, referred to as Recursive Orthogonal Label Regression (ROLR) by employing a recursive procedure. Due to the usage of a recursive procedure, the number of discriminant directions is independent of . At each iteration, discriminant features are generated, and thus ROLR is more powerful than the method in previous work. Experiment results on two face databases ORL and YALE, an objective database COIL20 and a terrain database TOUTEX disclose the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The latest video compression standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), has greatly improved the coding efficiency compared to the predecessor H.264/AVC. However, equipped with the quadtree structure of coding tree unit partition and other sophisticated coding tools, HEVC brings a significant increase in the computational complexity. To address this issue, a coding unit (CU) decision method based on fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) optimization, where the process of CU decision is formulated as a cascaded multi-level classification task. The optimal feature set is selected according to a defined misclassification cost and a risk area is introduced for an uncertain classification output. To further improve the RDC performance, different regulation parameters in SVM are adopted and outliers in training samples are eliminated. Additionally, the proposed CU decision method is incorporated into a joint RDC optimization framework, where the width of risk area is adaptively adjusted to allocate flexible computational complexity to different CUs, aiming at minimizing computational complexity under a configurable constraint in terms of RD performance degradation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce 58.9&amp;#x0025; and 55.3&amp;#x0025; computational complexity on average with the values of Bj&amp;#x00F8;nteggard delta peak-signal-to-noise ratio as -0.075 dB and -0.085 dB and the values of Bj&amp;#x00F8;ntegaard delta bit rate as 2.859&amp;#x0025; and 2.671&amp;#x0025; under low delay P and random access configurations, respectively, which has outperformed the state-of-the-art fast algorithms based on statistical information and machine learning.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The widespread use of surveillance cameras towards smart and safe city poses the critical but challenging problem of vehicle re-identification (Re-ID). The state-of-the-art research work performed vehicle re-identification relying on deep metric learning with a triplet network. However, most of existing methods basically ignore the impact of intra-class variance incorporated embedding on the performance of vehicle re-identification, in which robust fine-grained features for large-scale vehicle ReID have not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a deep metric learning method, Group Sensitive Triplet Embedding (GSTE), to recognize and retrieve vehicles, in which intra-class variance is elegantly modeled by incorporating an intermediate representation &quot;group&quot; between samples and each individual vehicle in the triplet network learning. To capture the intraclass variance attributes of each individual vehicle, we partition samples within each vehicle ID into a few groups, and build up the triplet samples at multiple granularities across different vehicle IDs as well as different groups within the same vehicle ID to learn fine-grained features. In particular, we construct a large scale vehicle database &quot;PKU-Vehicle&quot;, consisting of 10 million vehicle images captured by different surveillance cameras in several cities, to evaluate the vehicle Re-ID performance in real world video surveillance applications. Extensive experiments over benchmark datasets VehicleID, VeRI and CompCar have shown that the proposed GSTE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for vehicle Re-identification.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Human behavior can be analyzed using Eye tracker. Thus, it is used for revealing the cognitive processes for object identification. Cognitive process is the mental ability for identification of what our eyes see. Vision with 20/20 sometimes may not reveal the purpose. In this study, ambiguous images are taken to observe the cognitive process in participants. During the perception of an object, a participant uses goal-directed search for identifying various objects. Dense gaze coordinates provide the region of interests and are considered as the target regions for object identification in ambiguous images. These data are used to develop cognitive models for identification of ambiguous images. Features such as, eye fixation, pupil diameter, fixation duration, moments of inertia, and polar moments are used for developing the cognitive model. Three different feature selection methods along with six different classifiers are used for the task of classification. The selection of a subset of features using hypothesis testing performed well, compared to principal component analysis based dimensionality reduction method. This study could be used in detecting whether a participants is lying or not while perceiving an ambiguous image</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Effective incentive mechanisms are invaluable in mobile crowd sensing, for stimulating participation of smartphone users. Online auction mechanisms represent a natural solution for such sensing task allocation. Departing from existing studies that focus on an isolated system round, we optimize social cost across the system lifespan, while considering location constraints and capacity constraints when assigning sensing tasks to users. The winner determination problem (WDP) at each round is NP-hard even without inter-round coupling imposed by user capacity constraints. We first propose a truthful one-round auction, comprising of an approximation algorithm for solving the one-round WDP and a payment scheme for computing remuneration to winners. We then propose an online algorithm framework that employs the one-round auction as a building block towards a flexible mechanism that makes on-spot decisions upon dynamically arriving bids. Through both theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that our online auction is truthful, individually rational, computationally efficient, and achieves a good competitive ratio.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Twitter has become one of the most popular sources of real-time information about events happening in the world. Because of the overwhelming amount of information continuously flowing through the Twitter environment, topic derivation is essential. It indeed plays a valuable role in a variety of Twitterbased applications, including content recommendations, news summarization, market analysis, etc. Topic derivation methods are typically based on semantic features of tweet contents. Because tweets are short by nature, such methods suffer from data sparsity. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a topic derivation method that incorporates tweet text similarity and interactions measures. Besides the tweet contents, the approach takes into account several types of interactions amongst tweets: tweets which mention the same people, replies and retweets. Topic derivation is done through a two-step matrix factorization process. We conducted a number of experiments on several Twitter datasets to reveal both the individual and integrated effects of the various features being considered. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other advanced topic derivation methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Multitask learning (MTL) aims to learn multiple related tasks simultaneously instead of separately to improve the generalization performance of each task. Most existing MTL methods assumed that the multiple tasks to be learned have the same feature representation. However, this assumption may not hold for many real-world applications. In this paper, we study the problem of MTL with heterogeneous features for each task. To address this problem, we first construct an integrated graph of a set of bipartite graphs to build a connection among different tasks. We then propose a non-negative matrix factorization-based multitask method (MTNMF) to learn a common semantic feature space underlying different heterogeneous feature spaces of each task. Moreover, an improved version of MTNMF (IMTNMF) is proposed, in which we do not need to construct the correlation matrix between input features and class labels, avoiding the information loss. Finally, based on the common semantic features and original heterogeneous features, we model the heterogenous MTL problem as a multitask multiview learning (MTMVL) problem. In this way, a number of existing MTMVL methods can be applied to solve the problem effectively. Extensive experiments on three real-world problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and the improved version IMTNMF can gain about 2&amp;#x0025; average accuracy improvement compared with MTNMF.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Distributed graph computation is central to applications ranging from language processing to social networks. However, natural graphs tend to have skewed power-law distributions where a small subset of the vertices have a large number of neighbors. Existing graph-parallel systems suffer from load imbalance, high communication cost, and inefficient processing. To address this problem, in this paper we present GraphA, an adaptive scheme for efficient large-scale graph computation. At the core of GraphA is an adaptive and uniform graph partitioning algorithm, which partitions the datasets by using an incremental number of mapping functions. GraphA further improves and leverages the ART index structure to realize fine-grained and low-cost graph storage. We have implemented GraphA both on Spark and on GraphLab. Extensive evaluation shows that GraphA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph-parallel systems (GraphX and PowerLyra) in ingress time, execution time and storage cost, for both real-world and synthetic graphs. GraphA achieves up to &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$7.1 times$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; performance improvement over GraphX and 19:7% improvement over PowerLyra</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Increasingly advanced technology allows the monitoring of complex systems from a wide variety of perspectives. But the exploration of such systems from a multi-channel sensor information viewpoint remains a complicated challenge of ongoing interest. In this paper, firstly, based on well-designed double-layer distributed-sector conductance sensor, systematic oil-water and gas-liquid two-phase flow experiments are carried out to capture abundant spatio-temporal flow information. Secondly, well flow parameter measurement performance of DLDSC Sensor is effectively validated from the perspective of normalized conductance. Thirdly, a novel multiplex network-based model is presented to implement data mining and characterize the evolution of flow dynamics. The results demonstrate that the model is powerful for the exploration of the spatial flow behaviors from heterogeneity to randomness in the studied two-phase flows.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper studies a network process that can potentially be used to model cascading failures in networks. The Dynamic Bond Percolation (DBP) process models, through stochastic local rules, the failure or recovery of an edge (i, j) in a network. The probability that a working link fails or a failed link recovers may be independent of the state of other links or may be dependent locally on the state of neighboring links as described by a cascade function f. In applications, this means that failures or recovery of links may have a regional preference, or, alternatively, relationships between neighbors in the network can lead to changes in the links between neighbors of neighbors. This paper shows that the dynamic evolution of P(A, t), the probability that the network is in some state A, describing the collective states of all the links, at time t converges show that it converges to a stationary distribution. We use this distribution to study the emergence of global behaviors like consensus (i.e., catastrophic failure or full recovery of all the edges) or mixed (i.e., some failed and some working substructures). In particular, we show that, depending on the local dynamical rule, different network substructures, such as hub or triangle subgraphs, are more prone to failure.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We introduce the task of Visual Dialog, which requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a question about the image, the agent has to ground the question in image, infer context from history, and answer the question accurately. Visual Dialog is disentangled enough from a specific downstream task so as to serve as a general test of machine intelligence, while being sufficiently grounded in vision to allow objective evaluation of individual responses and benchmark progress. We develop a novel two-person real-time chat data-collection protocol to curate a large-scale Visual Dialog dataset (VisDial). VisDial v0.9 has been released and consists of &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$sim 1.2M$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; dialog question-answer pairs from 10-round, human-human dialogs grounded in &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$sim 120k$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt; images from the COCO dataset.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Multiple time series are a set of multiple quantitative variables occurring at the same interval. They are present in many domains such as medicine, finance, and manufacturing for analytical purposes. In recent years, streamgraph visualization (evolved from ThemeRiver) has been widely used for representing temporal evolution patterns in multiple time series. However, streamgraph as well as ThemeRiver suffer from scalability problems when dealing with several time series. To solve this problem, multiple time series can be organized into a hierarchical structure where individual time series are grouped hierarchically according to their proximity. In this paper, we present a new streamgraph-based approach to convey the hierarchical structure of multiple time series to facilitate the exploration and comparisons of temporal evolution. Based on a focus+context technique, our method allows time series exploration at different granularities (e. g., from overview to details). To illustrate our approach, two usage examples are presented.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Media data has been the subject of large scale analysis with applications of text mining being used to provide overviews of media themes and information flows. Such information extracted from media articles has also shown its contextual value of being integrated with other data, such as criminal records and stock market pricing. In this work, we explore linking textual media data with curated secondary textual data sources through user-guided semantic lexical matching for identifying relationships and data links. In this manner, critical information can be identified and used to annotate media timelines in order to provide a more detailed overview of events that may be driving media topics and frames. These linked events are further analyzed through an application of causality modeling to model temporal drivers between the data series. Such causal links are then annotated through automatic entity extraction which enables the analyst to explore persons, locations, and organizations that may be pertinent to the media topic of interest. To demonstrate the proposed framework, two media datasets and an armed conflict event dataset are explored.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Item-to-item collaborative filtering (aka. item-based CF) has been long used for building recommender systems in industrial settings, owing to its interpretability and efficiency in real-time personalization. In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF. In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF. The key to our design of NAIS is an attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in a user profile are more important for a prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art item-based CF method Factored Item Similarity Model (FISM), our NAIS has stronger representation power with only a few additional parameters brought by the attention network. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NAIS. This work is the first attempt that designs neural network models for item-based CF, opening up new research possibilities for future developments of neural recommender systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Short text streams such as search snippets and micro blogs have been popular on the Web with the emergence of social media. Unlike traditional normal text streams, these data present the characteristics of short length, weak signal, high volume, high velocity, topic drift, etc. Short text stream classification is hence a very challenging and significant task. However, this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Therefore, a new feature extension approach is proposed for short text stream classification with the help of a large-scale semantic network obtained from a Web corpus. It is built on an incremental ensemble classification model for efficiency. First, more semantic contexts based on the senses of terms in short texts are introduced to make up of the data sparsity using the open semantic network, in which all terms are disambiguated by their semantics to reduce the noise impact. Second, a concept cluster-based topic drifting detection method is proposed to effectively track hidden topic drifts. Finally, extensive studies demonstrate that as compared to several well-known concept drifting detection methods in data stream, our approach can detect topic drifts effectively, and it enables handling short text streams effectively while maintaining the efficiency as compared to several state-of-the-art short text classification approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we develop a general collective learning approach to model HHMD at an individual level towards identifying and quantifying the urban forms of residential communities. Specifically, our proposed method exploits two geographic regularities among HHMD. First, we jointly capture the correlations among residential communities, urban functions, temporal effects, and user mobility patterns by analogizing communities as documents and mobility patterns as words. Also, we further combine explicit LASSO analysis and significant testing into latent representation learning as a regularization term by analogizing compatible Point-of-Interests (POIs) as the meta-data of communities. In this way, we can learn the urban forms, including a mix of functions and corresponding portfolios, of residential communities from HHDM and POIs. We further leverage these learned results to address two application problems: real estate ranking and restaurant popularity prediction. Finally, we conduct intensive evaluations with a variety of real-world data, where experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling method and its successful applications for other problems</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>For dimension reduction on multiview data, most of the previous studies implicitly take an assumption that all samples are completed in all views. Nevertheless, this assumption could often be violated in real applications due to the presence of noise, limited access to data, equipment malfunction, and so on. Most of the previous methods will cease to work when missing values in one or multiple views occur, thus an incomplete-data oriented dimension reduction becomes an important issue. To this end, we mathematically formulate the above-mentioned issue as sparse low-rank representation through multiview subspace (SRRS) learning to impute missing values, by jointly measuring intraview relations (via sparse low-rank representation) and interview relations (through common subspace representation). Moreover, by exploiting various subspace priors in the proposed SRRS formulation, we develop three novel dimension reduction methods for incomplete multiview data: 1) multiview subspace learning via graph embedding; 2) multiview subspace learning via structured sparsity; and 3) sparse multiview feature selection via rank minimization. For each of them, the objective function and the algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem are elaborated, respectively. We perform extensive experiments to investigate their performance on three types of tasks including data recovery, clustering, and classification. Both two toy examples (i.e., Swiss roll and S-curve) and four real-world data sets (i.e., face images, multisource news, multicamera activity, and multimodality neuroimaging data) are systematically tested. As demonstrated, our methods achieve the performance superior to that of the state-of-the-art comparable methods. Also, the results clearly show the advantage of integrating the sparsity and low-rankness over using each of them separately.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Stochastic block models (SBMs) have been playing an important role in modeling clusters or community structures of network data. But, it is incapable of handling several complex features ubiquitously exhibited in real-world networks, one of which is the power-law degree characteristic. To this end, we propose a new variant of SBM, termed power-law degree SBM (PLD-SBM), by introducing degree decay variables to explicitly encode the varying degree distribution over all nodes. With an exponential prior, it is proved that PLD-SBM approximately preserves the scale-free feature in real networks. In addition, from the inference of variational E-Step, PLD-SBM is indeed to correct the bias inherited in SBM with the introduced degree decay factors. Furthermore, experiments conducted on both synthetic networks and two real-world datasets including Adolescent Health Data and the political blogs network verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of cluster prediction accuracies.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Private set intersection (PSI) is an essential cryptographic protocol that has many real world applications. As cloud computing power and popularity have been swiftly growing, it is now desirable to leverage the cloud to store private datasets and delegate PSI computation to it. Although a set of efficient PSI protocols have been designed, none support outsourcing of the datasets and the computation. In this paper, we propose two protocols for delegated PSI computation on outsourced private datasets. Our protocols have a unique combination of properties that make them particularly appealing for a cloud computing setting. Our first protocol, O-PSI, satisfies these properties by using additive homomorphic encryption and point-value polynomial representation of a set. Our second protocol, EO-PSI, is mainly based on a hash table and point-value polynomial representation and it does not require public key encryption; meanwhile, it retains all the desirable properties and is much more efficient than the first one. We also provide a formal security analysis of the two protocols in the semi-honest model and we analyze their performance utilizing prototype implementations we have developed. Our performance analysis shows that EO-PSI scales well and is also more efficient than similar state-of-the-art protocols for large set sizes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes bilateral contract networks as a new scalable market design for peer-to-peer energy trading. Coordinating small-scale distributed energy resources to shape overall demand could offer significant value to power systems, by alleviating the need for investments in upstream generation and transmission infrastructure, increasing network efficiency and increasing energy security. However, incentivising coordination between the owners of large-scale and small-scale energy resources at different levels of the power system remains an unsolved challenge. This paper introduces real-time and forward markets, consisting of energy contracts offered between generators with fuel-based sources, suppliers acting as intermediaries and consumers with inflexible loads, time-coupled flexible loads and/or renewable sources. For each type of agent, utility-maximising preferences for real-time contracts and forward contracts are derived. It is shown that these preferences satisfy full substitutability conditions essential for establishing the existence of a stable outcome &amp;#x2013; an agreed network of contracts specifying energy trades and prices, which agents do not wish to mutually deviate from. Important characteristics of energy trading are incorporated, including upstream-downstream energy balance and forward market uncertainty. Full substitutability ensures a distributed price-adjustment process can be used, which only requires local agent decisions and agent-to-agent communication between trading partners.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We present a new action recognition deep neural network which adaptively learns the best action velocities in addition to the classification. While deep neural networks have reached maturity for image understanding tasks, we are still exploring network topologies and features to handle the richer environment of video clips. Here, we tackle the problem of multiple velocities in action recognition, and provide state-of-the-art results for facial expression recognition, on known and new collected datasets. We further provide the training steps for our semi-supervised network, suited to learn from huge unlabeled datasets with only a fraction of labeled examples.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Clustering is a common approach for finding the intrinsic pattern structure embedded in unlabeled data. In this paper, a new clustering algorithm, called black hole entropic fuzzy clustering (BHEFC), is presented to absorb the merits of three aspects: 1) black hole entropy (BHE)-based information theory; 2) fuzzy clustering; and 3) Bayesian inference model. First, through the link between clustering and the black hole phenomenon in astrophysics, the minimum BHE criterion for fuzzy clustering is proposed. Then, it is revealed that BHE-based fuzzy clustering can be realized by using a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) framework, which in fact indicates that fuzziness and probability can co-jointly work in a collaborative rather than repulsive way. According to the proposed MAP framework for BHEFC, the fuzzifier m, which is limited to be less than 1 rather than bigger than 1 in fuzzy c-means, can be explained as the partition accuracy in the form of (1-m) for a dataset, and the fuzzy memberships and clustering centers can be determined in a probabilistic inference way, by means of iterative sampling with the assumption of the Dirichlet distribution of the fuzzy memberships. The incremental version of the proposed fuzzy clustering model is also developed here. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets and images for segmentation demonstrate the improved clustering results of the proposed algorithms over the comparison algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Image-based clothing retrieval is receiving increasing interest with the growth of online shopping. In practice, users may often have a desired piece of clothing in mind (e.g., either having seen it before on the street or requiring certain specific clothing attributes) but may be unable to supply an image as a query. We model this problem as a new type of image retrieval task in which the target image resides only in the user&amp;#x0027;s mind (called &amp;#x201C;mental image retrieval&amp;#x201D; hereafter). Because of the absence of an explicit query image, we propose to solve this problem through relevance feedback. Specifically, a new Bayesian formulation is proposed that simultaneously models the retrieval target and its high-level representation in the mind of the user (called the &amp;#x201C;user metric&amp;#x201D; hereafter) as posterior distributions of pre-fetched shop images and heterogeneous features extracted from multiple clothing attributes, respectively. Requiring only clicks as user feedback, the proposed algorithm is able to account for the variability in human decision-making. Experiments with real users demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Due to the tremendous growth of online social networks in both participants and collected contents, social data publication has provided an opportunity for numerous services. However, neglectfully publishing all the contents leads to severe disclosure of sensitive information due to diverse user behaviors. Therefore, there should be a thoroughly designed framework for data publication in online social networks that considers users heterogeneous privacy preferences and the correlations among participants. This work proposes a novel mechanism for data publication that achieves high performance while preserving privacy and guaranteeing fairness among users. To derive the optimal scheme for data publication is NP-complete. Thus we propose a heuristic algorithm to determine the contents to be published which takes advantage of the sets of sensitive contents for each user and the correlation among them. The theoretical analysis proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the mechanism. The evaluations towards a real-world dataset reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Outdoor images captured during haze weather conditions generally exhibit visibility degradation. The lack of the medium transmission and atmospheric lights from a single haze image leads to an ill-posed problem in atmospheric scattering model. This paper proposes a novel haze-density estimation model with a universal atmospheric-light extractor for single image dehazing. The proposed method employs the exponential inference to build exponential inference model for more accurately estimating haze density in contrast to the state-of-the-art methods. The coefficients in the proposed exponential inference model is learned by using a turbulent particle swarm optimization to seek the best approximation of medium transmission. Next, a novel universal atmospheric-light extractor based on the support vector data description is used to remedy the problem associated with the lack of atmospheric lights. The overall results via the qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method can substantially improve the dehazing efficacy while having less artifacts for the state-of-the-art haze removal methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>HTTP-based live streaming has become increasingly popular in recent years, and more users have started generating 4K live streams from their devices (e.g., mobile phones) through social-media service providers like Facebook or YouTube. If the audience is located far from a live stream source across the global Internet, TCP throughput becomes substantially suboptimal due to slow-start and congestion control mechanisms. This is especially the case when the end-to-end content delivery path involves radio access network (RAN) at the last mile. As a result, the data rate perceived by a mobile receiver may not meet the high requirement of 4K video streams, which causes deteriorated Quality-of-Experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose a scheme named Edge-based Transient Holding of Live sEgment (ETHLE), which addresses the issue above by performing context-aware transient holding of video segments at the mobile edge with virtualized content caching capability. Through holding the minimum number of live video segments at the mobile edge cache in a context-aware manner, the ETHLE scheme is able to achieve seamless 4K live streaming experiences across the global Internet by eliminating buffering and substantially reducing initial startup delay and live stream latency. It has been deployed as a virtual network function at an LTE-A network, and its performance has been evaluated using real live stream sources that are distributed around the world. The significance of this paper is that by leveraging virtualized caching resources at the mobile edge, we address the conventional transport-layer bottleneck and enable QoE-assured Internet-wide live streaming services with high data rate requirements.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Storage requirements for visual data have been increasing in recent years, following the emergence of many highly interactive multimedia services and applications for mobile devices in both personal and corporate scenarios. This has been a key driving factor for the adoption of cloud-based data outsourcing solutions. However, outsourcing data storage to the Cloud also leads to new security challenges that must be carefully addressed, especially regarding privacy. In this paper we propose a secure framework for outsourced privacy-preserving storage and retrieval in large shared image repositories. Our proposal is based on IES-CBIR, a novel Image Encryption Scheme that exhibits Content-Based Image Retrieval properties. The framework enables both encrypted storage and searching using Content-Based Image Retrieval queries while preserving privacy against honest-but-curious cloud administrators. We have built a prototype of the proposed framework, formally analyzed and proven its security properties, and experimentally evaluated its performance and retrieval precision. Our results show that IES-CBIR is provably secure, allows more efficient operations than existing proposals, both in terms of time and space complexity, and paves the way for new practical application scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Computational offloading can improve user experience of mobile apps through improved responsiveness and reduced energy footprint. Currently, offloading decisions are predominantly based on profiling performed on individual devices. While significant gains have been shown in benchmarks, these gains rarely translate to real-world use due to the complexity of contexts and parameters that affect offloading. We contribute by proposing crowdsensed evidence traces as a novel mechanism for improving the performance of offloading systems. Instead of limiting to profiling individual devices, crowdsensing enables characterising execution contexts across a community of users, providing better generalisation and coverage of contexts. We demonstrate the feasibility of using crowdsensing to characterize offloading contexts through an analysis of two crowdsensing datasets. Motivated by our results, we present the design and development of EMCO toolkit and platform as a novel solution for computational offloading. Experiments carried out on a testbed deployment in Amazon EC2 Ireland demonstrate that EMCO can consistently accelerate app execution while at the same time reduce energy footprint. We demonstrate that EMCO provides better scalability than current cloud platforms, being able to serve a larger number of clients without variations in performance. Our framework, use cases, and tools are available as open source from github.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a spatio-temporal trajectory clustering method for vehicle trajectories in transportation networks to identify heterogeneous trip patterns and explore underlying network assignment mechanisms. The proposed algorithm ST-TOPOSCAN is designed to consider both temporal and spatial information in trajectories. We adopt the time-dependent shortest-path distance measurement and take advantage of topological relations of a predefined network to discover the shared sub-paths among trajectories and construct the clusters. The proposed algorithm is implemented with a trajectory dataset obtained in the Chicago area. The results confirm the method's ability to extract and generate spatio-temporal (sub-)trajectory clusters and identify trip patterns. Extensive numerical experiments verify the method's performance and computational efficiency. Through spatio-temporal data mining, this paper contributes to exploring traffic system dynamics and advancing state-of-the-art spatio-temporal clustering for vehicle trajectories.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The large availability of multi&amp;#x2013;gigabit network cards for commodity PCs requires network applications to potentially cope with high volumes of traffic. However, computation intensive operations may not catch up with high traffic rates and need to be run in parallel over multiple processing cores. As of today, the vast majority of network applications &amp;#x2013; e.g. monitoring and IDS systems &amp;#x2013; are still based on the pcap library interface which, unfortunately, does not provide the native multi&amp;#x2013;core support, even though the current underlying capture technologies do. This paper introduces a novel version of the pcap library for the Linux operating system that enables transparent application level parallelism. The new library supports fan&amp;#x2013;out operations for both multi&amp;#x2013;threaded and multi&amp;#x2013;process applications, by means of extended API as well as by a declarative grammar for configuration files, suitable for legacy applications. In addition, the library can transparently run on top of the standard Linux socket as well as on other accelerated active engines. Performance evaluation has been carried out on a multi&amp;#x2013;core architecture in pure capture tests and in more realistic use cases involving monitoring applications such as Tstat and Bro, with standard Linux socket as well as PF&amp;#x005F;RING and PFQ accelerated engines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recent advances in the telecommunication industry offer great opportunities to citizens and organizations in a globally connected world, but they also arise a vast number of complex challenges that decision makers must face. Some of these challenges can be modeled as combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Frequently, these COPs are large-size, NP-hard, and must be solved in &amp;#x201C;real time,&amp;#x201D; which makes necessary the use of metaheuristics. The first goal of this paper is to provide a review on how metaheuristics have been used so far to deal with COPs associated with telecommunication systems, detecting the main trends and challenges. Particularly, the analysis focuses on the network design, routing, and allocation problems. In addition, due to the nature of these challenges, the paper discusses how the hybridization of metaheuristics with methodologies such as simulation and machine learning can be employed to extend the capabilities of metaheuristics when solving stochastic and dynamic COPs in the telecommunication industry.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In long lifespan software systems, specification documents can be outdated or even missing. Developing new software releases or checking whether some user requirements are still valid becomes challenging in this context. This challenge can be addressed by extracting high-level observable capabilities of a system by mining its source code and the available source-level documentation. This paper presents feature extraction and traceability (FEAT), an approach that automatically extracts topoi, which are summaries of the main capabilities of a program, given under the form of collections of code functions along with an index. FEAT acts in two steps: first, clustering: by mining the available source code, possibly augmented with code-level comments, hierarchical agglomerative clustering groups similar code functions. In addition, this process gathers an index for each function. Second, entry point selection: functions within a cluster are then ranked and presented to validation engineers as topoi candidates. We implemented FEAT on top of a general-purpose test management and optimization platform and performed an experimental study over 15 open-source software projects amounting to more than 1 M lines of codes proving that automatically discovering topoi is feasible and meaningful on realistic projects.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This article is about the relation between human observers and various human and non-human entities. Our focus is on humans&amp;#x0027; perception of movement. In particular how it affects the relationship to entities. We explore the way the movement of natural entities, locomoting animals and robots or the expressivity of dancers, play a vital part in our perception of these things. Humans&amp;#x0027; intuitive process of categorizing and attributing characteristics as a dialog and understanding of things, as found in the concept of metaphor, is central to our method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The social signal processing (SSP) is gaining popularity as a promising automated technology that aims at providing computers with the ability to sense and understand human social behaviors. Representative examples of SSP applications are novel human-computer interaction mechanisms that have enhanced machine sensitivity of the interacting person&amp;#x2019;s emotional/mental states, entertainment technology with more engaging games, ambient intelligence systems that are responsive to social context, and psychologist devising new quantitative evaluation tools useful for coaching or diagnosis. Based on adopted cues, existing SSP methods can be categorized as verbal and nonverbal. Over the last decade significant progress has been accomplished in visual nonverbal behavior analysis (VNBA). However, several emerging issues, such as fusion of multimodal cues, context estimation, and user user&amp;#x2019;s privacy, still need to be addressed adequately. This article presents an overview of VNBA, enlists challenges, analyzes solutions proposed to overcome them and highlights interdisciplinary research opportunities in this field.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>To uncover latent data structure in big data, a high-order clustering algorithm by fast search and find of density peaks has emerged recently, and will bring great application values in Industrial Internet-of-Things data management and analysis. With the popularity of cloud computing, it provides users with the convenience of outsourcing calculations while bringing the risk of privacy disclosure. Aiming at the problem above, from the characteristics of the secure cloud service system, this paper proposes a secure high-order clustering algorithm by fast search and find of density peaks on hybrid cloud. In the proposed scheme, the client first builds the encrypted object tensors with user data using homomorphic encryption, then uploads them to the cloud to completely implement the high-order clustering computing by fast search and find of density peaks over the encrypted object tensors. In the end, clustering results perturbed with random number are returned to client for remove perturbation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a smart grid data set in terms of clustering accuracy, efficiency and speedup ratio. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach can accurately and effectively cluster big data without disclosing user privacy while ensuring that the client is very lightweight. Therefore, the proposed scheme with high security and scalability is suitable for clustering Industrial Internet-of-Things big data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Spatiotemporal context is crucial in modern mobile applications that utilize increasing amounts of context to better predict events and user behaviors, requiring rich records of users&amp;#x0027; or devices&amp;#x0027; spatiotemporal histories. Maintaining these rich histories requires frequent sampling and indexed storage of spatiotemporal data that pushes the limits of resource-constrained mobile devices. Today&amp;#x0027;s apps offload processing and storing contextual information, but this increases response time, often relies on the user&amp;#x0027;s data connection, and runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper we motivate the feasibility of on-loading large amounts of context and introduce Paco (Programming Abstraction for Contextual On-loading), an architecture for on-loading data that optimizes for location and time while allowing flexibility in storing additional context. The Paco API&amp;#x0027;s innovations enable on-loading very dense traces of information, even given devices&amp;#x0027; resource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for Android, we demonstrate that Paco can support expressive application queries entirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses Paco&amp;#x0027;s energy consumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy. Further, Paco facilitates unified contextual reasoning across multiple applications and also supports user-controlled release of contextual data to other devices or the cloud; we demonstrate these assets through a proof-of-concept case study.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>When an epidemic spreads in a given network of individuals or communities, can we detect its source using only the information provided by a small set of nodes? We propose a general framework that incorporates two dimensions. First, we can either rely exclusively on a set of selected nodes (i.e., sensors) which always reveal their state independently of any particular epidemic (these are called static), or we can add some sensors (called dynamic) as an epidemic spreads, depending on which additional information is required. Second, the method can either localizes the source after an epidemic has spread through the entire network (offline), or while the epidemic is ongoing (online).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the unprecedented advancement of sensing technology, smart city applications now have access to rich measurement data related to system dynamics, states, and the behavior of its users. However, classic data analysis or machine learning tools ignore some unique characteristics of the multi-stream measurement data, in particular, the co-existence of strong temporal correlation and inter-stream relatedness. In this study, we consider the problem of novelty detection with multiple co-evolving time series data. To capture both the temporal dependence and the inter-series relatedness, a multi-task non-parametric model is proposed, which can be extended to data with a broader exponential family distribution by adopting the notion of Bregman divergence. Albeit convex, the learning problem can be hard as the time series accumulate. In this regards, an efficient randomized block coordinate descent (RBCD) algorithm is proposed. The model and the algorithm is tested with a real-world application, involving novelty detection and event analysis in smart city power distribution networks with high-resolution multi-stream measurements. It is shown that the incorporation of inter-series relatedness enables the detection of system-level events which would otherwise be unobservable with traditional methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the development of speech synthesis technology, automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems have encountered the serious challenge of spoofing attacks. In order to improve the security of ASV systems, many antispoofing countermeasures have been developed. In the front-end domain, much research has been conducted on finding effective features which can distinguish spoofed speech from genuine speech and the published results show that dynamic acoustic features work more effectively than static ones. In the back-end domain, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and deep neural networks (DNNs) are the two most popular types of classifiers used for spoofing detection. The log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) generated by the difference of human and spoofing log-likelihoods are used as spoofing detection scores. In this paper, we train a five-layer DNN spoofing detection classifier using dynamic acoustic features and propose a novel, simple scoring method only using human log-likelihoods (HLLs) for spoofing detection. We mathematically prove that the new HLL scoring method is more suitable for the spoofing detection task than the classical LLR scoring method, especially when the spoofing speech is very similar to the human speech. We extensively investigate the performance of five different dynamic filter bank-based cepstral features and constant Q cepstral coefficients (CQCC) in conjunction with the DNN-HLL method. The experimental results show that, compared to the GMM-LLR method, the DNN-HLL method is able to significantly improve the spoofing detection accuracy. Compared with the CQCC-based GMM-LLR baseline, the proposed DNN-HLL model reduces the average equal error rate of all attack types to 0.045&amp;#x0025;, thus exceeding the performance of previously published approaches for the ASVspoof 2015 Challenge task. Fusing the CQCC-based DNN-HLL spoofing detection system with ASV systems, the false acceptance rate on spoofing attacks can be reduced significantly.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The advancements in computer systems and networks have created a new environment for criminal acts, widely known as cybercrime. Cybercrime incidents are occurrences of particular criminal offences that pose a serious threat to the global economy, safety, and well-being of society. This paper offers a comprehensive understanding of cybercrime incidents and their corresponding offences combining a series of approaches reported in relevant literature. Initially, this paper reviews and identifies the features of cybercrime incidents, their respective elements and proposes a combinatorial incident description schema. The schema provides the opportunity to systematically combine various elements--or cybercrime characteristics. Additionally, a comprehensive list of cybercrime-related offences is put forward. The offences are ordered in a two-level classification system based on specific criteria to assist in better classification and correlation of their respective incidents. This enables a thorough understanding of the repeating and underlying criminal activities. The proposed system can serve as a common reference overtaking obstacles deriving from misconceptions for cybercrimes with cross-border activities. The proposed schema can be extended with a list of recommended actions, corresponding measures and effective policies that match with the offence type and subsequently with a particular incident. This matching will enable better monitoring, handling and moderate cybercrime incident occurrences. The ultimate objective is to incorporate the schema-based description of cybercrime elements to a complete incident management system with standard operating procedures and protocols.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Locations, e.g. countries, states, cities, and point-of-interests, are central to news, emergency events, and people&amp;#x0027;s daily lives. Automatic identification of locations associated with or mentioned in documents has been explored for decades. As one of the most popular online social network platforms, Twitter has attracted a large number of users who send millions of tweets on daily basis. Due to the world-wide coverage of its users and real-time freshness of tweets, location prediction on Twitter has gained significant attention in recent years. Research efforts are spent on dealing with new challenges and opportunities brought by the noisy, short, and context-rich nature of tweets. In this survey, we aim at offering an overall picture of location prediction on Twitter. Specifically, we concentrate on the prediction of user home locations, tweet locations, and mentioned locations. We first define the three tasks and review the evaluation metrics. By summarizing Twitter network, tweet content, and tweet context as potential inputs, we then structurally highlight how the problems depend on these inputs. Each dependency is illustrated by a comprehensive review of the corresponding strategies adopted in state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we also briefly review two related problems, i.e. semantic location prediction and point-of-interest recommendation. Finally, we make a conclusion of the survey.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>When retrieving images for an object of interest from social images, it becomes more and more important to make the retrieved images not only be similar to the object instance in the query image but also cover as more diverse aspects (e.g., viewpoints or poses) of an object as possible. This is called the diversity-induced image retrieval. However existing methods make the retrieved images to be diverse by directly measuring the dissimilarity of images based on some local features, but neglect the image semantics, e.g., visual concepts underlying the image collection. Besides, the previous diversity-induced image retrieval algorithms often explore single modal information such as textual or visual information, which cannot leverage multimodal information to enhance the diversity of retrieval results. In this paper, we propose a new framework to diversify retrieval results by discovering the latent concepts (i.e., semantic aspects) underlying the image collection. In particular, we apply latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on visual features to discover latent aspects from the initial retrieval results, and then we design three text-based schemes to make the topics more coherent to a clear semantic meaning. At last, the final retrieval results are generated by selecting representative images from the discovered topics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of social network and multimedia technology, customized image and video stylization has been widely used for various social-media applications. In this paper, we explore the problem of exemplar-based photo style transfer, which provides a flexible and convenient way to invoke fantastic visual impression. Rather than investigating some fixed artistic patterns to represent certain styles as was done in some previous works, our work emphasizes styles related to a series of visual effects in the photograph, e.g. color, tone, and contrast. We propose a photo stylistic brush, an automatic robust style transfer approach based on Superpixel-based Bipartite Graph (SuperBIG). A two-step bipartite graph algorithm with different granularity levels is employed to aggregate pixels into superpixels and find their correspondences. In the first step, with the extracted hierarchical features, a bipartite graph is constructed to describe the content similarity for pixel partition to produce superpixels. In the second step, superpixels in the input/reference image are rematched to form a new superpixelbased bipartite graph, and superpixel-level correspondences are generated by a bipartite matching. Finally, the refined correspondence guides SuperBIG to perform the transformation in a decorrelated color space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for transferring various styles of exemplar images, even for some challenging cases, such as night images.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, many fields that experience a sudden proliferation of data, which increases the volume of data that must be processed and the variety of formats the data is stored in have been identified. This causes pressure on existing compute infrastructures and data analysis methods, as more and more data is considered as a useful source of information for making critical decisions in particular fields. Among these fields exist several areas related to human life, e.g., various branches of medicine, where the uncertainty of data complicates the data analysis, and where the inclusion of fuzzy expert knowledge in data processing brings many advantages. In this paper, we show how fuzzy techniques can be incorporated in Big Data analytics carried out with the declarative U-SQL language over a Big Data Lake located on the Cloud. We define the concept of Big Data Lake together with the Extract, Process, and Store (EPS) process performed while schematizing and processing data from the Data Lake, and while storing results of the processing. Our solution, developed as a Fuzzy Search Library for Data Lake, introduces the possibility of (1) massively-parallel, declarative querying of Big Data Lake with simple and complex fuzzy search criteria, (2) using fuzzy linguistic terms in various data transformations, and (3) fuzzy grouping. Presented ideas are exemplified by a distributed analysis of large volumes of biomedical data on Microsoft Azure cloud. Results of performed tests confirm that the presented solution is highly scalable on the Cloud and is a successful step toward soft and declarative processing of data on a large scale. The solution presented in this paper directly addresses three characteristics of Big Data, i.e., volume, variety, and velocity, and indirectly addresses, veracity and value.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Linguistic modifiers such as negators (e.g., not), intensifiers (e.g., very) and modals (e.g., would) are commonly used in expressing opinions. These modifiers play an important role in recognizing the sentiment intensity of multi-word phrases because they may lead to an intensity shift and polarity reversal for the words they modify. Appropriately modeling the effect of such modifiers on intensity shift can greatly improve the performance of phrase-level sentiment intensity prediction. To this end, this paper proposes two neural network (NN) models organized in a pipelined fashion to determine 1) the intensity of individual words and 2) shift weights of modifiers representing the degrees of intensity change for the words they modify. The phrase intensity can then be determined by combining the word intensity and modifier weight. When measuring word intensity, the first NN model introduces a hidden layer as a filter to select appropriate similar seed words in the prediction process. In learning modifier weights, the second NN model considers both the weights of individual and group of modifiers to capture various intensity shift effects caused by the modifiers. Experiments on a SemEval-2016 dataset showed that the proposed method yielded better prediction performance for both single words and multi-word phrases.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>It is desired (especially for young people) to shop for the same or similar products shown in the multimedia contents (such as online TV programs). This indicates an urgent demand for improving the experience of TV-to-Online (T2O). In this paper, a transfer learning approach as well as a prototype system for effortless T2O experience is developed. In the system, a key component is high precision product search, which is to fulfill exact matching between a query item and the database ones. The matching performance primarily relies on distance estimation, but the data characteristics cannot be well modeled and exploited by a simple Euclidean (EU) distance. This motivates us to introduce distance metric learning (DML) for improving the distance estimation. However, in traditional DML methods, the side information (such as the similar/dissimilar constraints or relevance/irrelevance judgements) in target domain is leveraged. These methods may fail due to limited side information. Fortunately, this issue can be alleviated by utilizing transfer metric learning (TML) to exploit information from other related domains. In this paper, a novel Manifold Regularized Heterogeneous Multi-Task Metric Learning (MRHMTML) framework is proposed, in which each domain is treated equally. The proposed approach allows to simultaneously exploit the information from other domains and the unlabeled information. Furthermore, the ranking-based loss is adopted to make our model more appropriate for search. Experiments on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This transfer metric learning approach is expected to impact the transformation of the emerging T2O trend in both TV and online video domains.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, most users carry high computing power mobile devices where speech recognition is certainly one of the main technologies available in every modern smartphone, although battery draining and application performance (resource shortage) have a big impact on the experienced quality. Shifting applications and services to the cloud may help to improve mobile user satisfaction as demonstrated by several ongoing efforts in the mobile cloud area. However, the quality of speech recognition is still not sufficient in many complex cases to replace the common hand written text, especially when prompt reaction to short-term provisioning requests is required. To address the new scenario, this paper proposes a mobile cloud infrastructure to support the extraction of semantics information from speech recognition in the Social Care domain, where carers have to speak about their patients conditions in order to have reliable notes used afterward to plan the best support. We present not only an architecture proposal, but also a real prototype that we have deployed and thoroughly assessed with different queries, accents, and in presence of load peaks, in our experimental mobile cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) testbed based on Cloud Foundry.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Alcohol consumption is the number one risk factor for morbidity and mortality among young people. In late adolescence and early adulthood, excessive drinking and intoxication are more common than in any other life period, increasing the risk of adverse physical and psychological health consequences. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of using smartphone sensor data and machine learning to automatically characterize and classify drinking behavior of young adults in an urban, ecologically valid nightlife setting. Our work has two contributions. First, we use previously unexplored data from a large-scale mobile crowdsensing study involving 241 young participants in two urban areas in a European country, which includes phone data (location. accelerometer, Wifi, Bluetooth, battery, screen, and app usage) along with self-reported, fine-grain data on individual alcoholic drinks consumed on Friday and Saturday nights over a three-month period. Second, we build a machine learning methodology to infer whether an individual consumed alcohol on a given weekend night, based on her/his smartphone data contributed between 8PM and 4AM. We found that accelerometer data is the most informative single cue, and that a combination of features results in an overall accuracy of 76.6%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In order to solve large-scale lasso problems, screening algorithms have been developed that discard features with zero coefficients based on a computationally efficient screening rule. Most existing screening rules were developed from a spherical constraint and half-space constraints on a dual optimal solution. However, existing rules admit at most two half-space constraints due to the computational cost incurred by the half-spaces, even though additional constraints may be useful to discard more features. In this paper, we present AdaScreen, an adaptive lasso screening rule ensemble, which allows to combine any one sphere with multiple half-space constraints on a dual optimal solution. Thanks to geometrical considerations that lead to a simple closed form solution for AdaScreen, we can incorporate multiple half-space constraints at small computational cost. In our experiments, we show that AdaScreen with multiple half-space constraints simultaneously improves screening performance and speeds up lasso solvers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Educational resources can be easily found on the Web; most search engines base their algorithms on the resources text or popularity. Teachers must navigate the results until they find an appropriate resource making search a tedious and cumbersome task. Specialized repositories contain resources that are annotated with metadata that aims to facilitate the discovery of quality resources. Nevertheless, content abundance and variety makes searching a complex task. Recommender systems can assist teachers in finding the proper content either by determining clusters of similar users, and inferring the user interest on a resource; clusters of similar resources, or a mix of both. Probabilistic model based (PMB) techniques, on the other hand, make possible to classify resources into more than one cluster with diverse probability degree. In this paper we use recommender systems and PMB techniques to analyze a dataset produced by primary and secondary level teachers during four years and under natural conditions. We found that a hybrid recommendation, the CTR technique, performs better than other approaches despite the high sparseness of the dataset. In addition, learning resources annotated with curriculum metadata had a positive impact on recommenders accuracy whereas free-text or other metadata negatively impacted the results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This study deals with the strong relationship between emotions and music, investigating three main research questions: (RQ1) Are there differences in human music perception (e.g., emotions, tempo, instrumentation, and complexity), according to musical education, experience, demographics, and personality traits?; (RQ2) Do certain perceived music characteristics correlate (e.g., tension and sadness), irrespective of a particular listener&amp;#x2019;s background or personality?; (RQ3) Does human perception of music characteristics, such as emotions and tempo, correlate with descriptors extracted from music audio signals? To investigate our research questions, we conducted two user studies focusing on different groups of subjects. We used web-based surveys to collect information about demographics, listening habits, musical education, personality, and perceptual ratings with respect to perceived emotions, tempo, complexity, and instrumentation for 15 segments of Beethoven&amp;#x2019;s 3rd symphony, &amp;#x201C;Eroica&amp;#x201D;. Our experiments showed that all three research questions can be affirmed, at least partly. We found strong support for RQ2 and RQ3, while RQ1 could be confirmed only for some perceptual aspects and user groups.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social connections among network nodes have been well investigated as an additional opportunity in network design (e.g., in routing strategies and trusted networking). This paper presents a paradigm shift that explores the design and performance analysis of combining social links jointly with communication links for message delivery in wireless networks. In a combined multi-layer social and communication network, communication links are based on conventional wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth) and social links are overlaid over a communication infrastructure (e.g., cellular network) that provides an alternative way for data transmission. The goal is to characterize the performance analytically when routing is designed by combining social and communication links. A distance discretization technique is applied to model the message delivery reliability and delay. The analytical foundation is developed to analyze the end-to-end delay and success probability under various effects of persistent transmission, potential error in distance estimation and mobility. Systematic routing strategies that employ network inference are then designed to improve the performance in different aspects, such as delivery delay, delivery success probability, and energy-saving. A network emulation testbed is implemented with actual radios and real-world social network datasets to measure the performance of a heterogeneous network with social and communication links. The results in this paper show that the integration of social links in wireless network routing as a multi-layer design leads to substantial performance improvement for delay and reliability of message delivery.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The inbuilt multi-window feature released with Android Nougat has enabled simultaneous working and visualization of multiple applications on mobile display screen. However, multi-window operations result in unnecessary energy drain due to increased multitasking, CPU load, and multithread processing. Considering linear dependency between power consumed and the displayed colors, we present design and realization of MultiDroid, a novel display power reduction technique during multi-window operations for the OLED screens. MultiDroid employs dynamic local dimming based on the context switching between the application pair displayed on the screen. The display optimization works based on the user interaction with the mobile screen, where dynamic changes on the display screens are implemented for the non-critical application window. MultiDroid architecture is validated through power modeling and correctness verification. Furthermore, a survey on multi-window usages has been conducted reflecting the application usages pattern. The performance of MultiDroid is evaluated on preferred application pairs on multi-window framework obtained from the survey. Modeling and comparative analysis of the energy profiles for the devised test cases on optimized and default multi-window screens reflect around 10&amp;#x0025; to 25&amp;#x0025; reduction in the overall device power consumption per hour with a negligible performance degradation. After experimental validation, we present user acceptance and feasibility of MultiDroid based on the feedback from 50 participants.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the popularity of sensor-rich mobile devices (e.g., smart phones and wearable devices), Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) has emerged as an effective method for data collection and processing. Compared with traditional Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN), MCS holds many advantages such as mobility, scalability, cost-efficiency, and human intelligence. However, MCS still faces many challenges with regard to security, privacy and trust. This paper provides a survey of these challenges and discusses potential solutions. We analyze the characteristics of MCS, identify its security threats, and outline essential requirements on a secure, privacy-preserving and trustworthy MCS system. Further, we review existing solutions based on these requirements and compare their pros and cons. Finally, we point out open issues and propose some future research directions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition is currently a hot issue in the affective computing community. Numerous studies have been published on this topic, following generally the same schema: 1) presentation of emotional stimuli to a number of subjects during the recording of their EEG, 2) application of machine learning techniques to classify the subjects&amp;#x0027; emotions. The proposed approaches vary mainly in the type of features extracted from the EEG and in the employed classifiers, but it is difficult to compare the reported results due to the use of different datasets. In this paper, we present a new database for the analysis of valence (positive or negative emotions), which is made publicly available. The database comprises physiological recordings and 257-channel EEG data, contrary to all previously published datasets, which include at most 62 EEG channels. Furthermore, we reconstruct the brain activity on the cortical surface by applying source localization techniques. We then compare the performances of valence classification that can be achieved with various features extracted from all source regions (source space features) and from all EEG channels (sensor space features), showing that the source reconstruction improves the classification results. Finally, we discuss the influence of several parameters on the classification scores.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Based on the notion of ?emergence?, Xu et al.(Usenix Security'2012;TDSC'2013)developed the first concrete instantiation of emerging-image moving-object(EIMO)CAPTCHAs using 2D-hollow objects(codewords), shown to be usable and believed to be secure. In this paper, we highlight the security weaknesses of such a 2D-EIMO CAPTCHA design. A key vulnerability is that the camera projection on 2D objects is constant, making it possible to reconstruct the underlying codewords by superimposing and aggregating the temporally scattered parts of the object extracted from consecutive frames. We design and implement an automated attack to defeat this design using image processing techniques, and show that its accuracy in recognizing moving codewords is up to 89.2%. Our framework can be broadly used to undermine the security of different instances of 2D-EIMO CAPTCHAs, given the generalized and robust back-end theories in our attack, namely the methods to locate a codeword, reduce noises and accumulate objects? contour information from consecutive frames corresponding to multiple time periods. As a countermeasure, we propose a fundamentally different design of EIMO CAPTCHAs based on pseudo 3D objects, and examine its security and usability. We argue that this design can resist our attack against 2D-EIMO, although at the cost of reduced usability compared to?-now insecure?-2D-EIMO CAPTCHAs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of e-commerce, logistics industry becomes a crucial component in the e-commercial ecological chain. Impelled by both economical and environmental benefit, logistics companies demand automated tools more urgently than ever. In this paper, a dynamic logistic dispatching system is proposed. The underlying model of the dispatching system is the dynamic vehicle routing problem which allows new orders being received as the working day progress. With this feature, the system becomes more practical than the systems with traditional static vehicle routing models, but is also more challenging as the vehicles must be scheduled in a dynamic way. The core of the system is a specially designed set-based particle swarm optimization algorithm. According to the characteristic of the problem, a new encoding scheme is defined by set and possibility, and a local refinement method is designed to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. In addition, two more techniques: 1) region partition and 2) archive strategy are incorporated in the dispatching system to reduce the complexity of the problem and to facilitate the optimization process, helping the dispatcher control the vehicles in real time. The proposed system is tested on various benchmarks with different scales. Experimental results show that the proposed dispatching system is effective.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The vast array of information available on the Web makes it a challenge for readers to quickly browse through and decide about the importance and relevance of content. Interpreting large-volumes of data is particularly demanding for users with handheld devices in the social media and micro-blogging sphere. Various approaches address this challenge through text summarization, content ranking and personalized recommendation. We describe a family of techniques that help users understand text by automatically annotating text with pictures, referred to as text picturing. The objective is to find a set of pictures that cover the main concepts in a textual snippet. We provide an overview of text picturing, its constituent steps such as knowledge extraction, mapping, scene rendering, as well as application areas. We give a picturing-related literature overview, and list use-cases that offer IT professionals insight into how picturing techniques can be successfully incorporated into real world applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The structural graph clustering algorithm SCAN is a fundamental technique for managing and analyzing graph data. However, its high runtime remains a computational bottleneck, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive approach for tackling this problem on multicore CPUs. Our algorithm, called anySCAN, iteratively processes vertices in blocks. The acquired results are merged into an underlying cluster structure consisting of the so-called super-nodes for building clusters. During its runtime, anySCAN can be suspended for examining intermediate results and resumed for finding better results at arbitrary time points, making it an anytime algorithm which is capable of handling very large graphs in an interactive way and under arbitrary time constraints. Moreover, its block processing scheme allows the design of a scalable parallel algorithm on shared memory architectures such as multicore CPUs for speeding up the algorithm further at each iteration. Consequently, anySCAN uniquely is a both interactive and work-efficient parallel algorithm. We further introduce danySCAN an efficient bulk update scheme for anySCAN on dynamic graphs in which the clusters are updated in bulks and in a parallel interactive scheme. Experiments are conducted on very large real graph datasets for demonstrating the performance of anySCAN. They show its ability to acquire very good approximate results early, leading to orders of magnitude speedup compared to SCAN and its variants. Moreover, it scales very well with the number of threads when dealing with both static and dynamic graphs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a random walk approach to the problem of querying informative constraints for clustering. The proposed method is based on the properties of the commute time, that is the expected time taken for a random walk to travel between two nodes and return, on the adjacency graph of data. Commute time has the nice property of that, the more short paths connect two given nodes in a graph, the more similar those nodes are. Since computing the commute time takes the Laplacian eigenspectrum into account, we use this property in a recursive fashion to query informative constraints for clustering. At each recursion, the proposed method constructs the adjacency graph of data and utilizes the spectral properties of the commute time matrix to bipartition the adjacency graph. Thereafter, the proposed method benefits from the commute times distance on graph to query informative constraints between partitions. This process iterates for each partition until the stop condition becomes true. Experiments on real-world data show the efficiency of the proposed method for constraints selection.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Chaotic time series widely exists in nature and society (e.g., meteorology, physics, economics, etc.), which usually exhibits seemingly unpredictable features due to its inherent nonstationary and high complexity. Thankfully, multifarious advanced approaches have been developed to tackle the prediction issues, such as statistical methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines. Among them, the interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN), which is a synergistic integration of fuzzy logic systems and ANNs, has received wide attention in the field of chaotic time series prediction. This paper begins with the structural features and superiorities of IT2FNN. Moreover, chaotic characters identification and phase-space reconstruction matters for prediction are presented. In addition, we also offer a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art applications of IT2FNN, with an emphasis on chaotic time series prediction and summarize their main contributions as well as some hardware implementations for computation speedup. Finally, this paper trends and extensions of this field, along with an outlook of future challenges are revealed. The primary objective of this paper is to serve as a tutorial or referee for interested researchers to have an overall picture on the current developments and identify their potential research direction to further investigation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The recent expansion of pervasive computing technology has contributed with novel means to pursue human activities in urban space. The urban dynamics unveiled by these means generate an enormous amount of data. These data are mainly endowed by portable and radio-frequency devices, transportation systems, video surveillance, satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and social networking services. This has opened a new avenue of opportunities, to understand and predict urban dynamics in detail, and plan various real-time services and applications in response to that. Over the last decade, certain aspects of the crowd, e.g., mobility, sentimental, size estimation and behavioral, have been analyzed in detail and the outcomes have been reported. This paper mainly conducted an extensive survey on various data sources used for different urban applications, the state-of-the-art on urban data generation techniques and associated processing methods in order to demonstrate their merits and capabilities. Then, available open-access crowd data sets for urban event detection are provided along with relevant application programming interfaces. In addition, an outlook on a support system for urban application is provided which fuses data from all the available pervasive technology sources and finally, some open challenges and promising research directions are outlined.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we present a method for reconstructing the drawing process of Chinese brush paintings. We demonstrate the possibility of computing an artistically reasonable drawing order from a static brush painting that is consistent with the rules of art. We map the key principles of drawing composition to our computational framework, which first organizes the strokes in three stages and then optimizes stroke ordering with natural evolution strategies. Our system produces reasonable animated constructions of Chinese brush paintings with minimal or no user intervention. We test our algorithm on a range of input paintings with varying degrees of complexity and structure and then evaluate the results via a user study. We discuss the applications of the proposed system to painting instruction, painting animation, and image stylization, especially in the context of art teaching.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Advanced communications and data processing technologies bring great benefits to the smart grid. However, cyber-security threats also extend from the information system to the smart grid. The existing security works for smart grid focus on traditional protection and detection methods. However, a lot of threats occur in a very short time and overlooked by exiting security components. These threats usually have huge impacts on smart gird and disturb its normal operation. Moreover, it is too late to take action to defend against the threats once they are detected, and damages could be difficult to repair. To address this issue, this paper proposes a security situational awareness mechanism based on the analysis of big data in the smart grid. Fuzzy cluster based analytical method, game theory and reinforcement learning are integrated seamlessly to perform the security situational analysis for the smart grid. The simulation and experimental results show the advantages of our scheme in terms of high efficiency and low error rate for security situational awareness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Quantifying the similarity between two networks is critical in many applications. A number of algorithms have been proposed to compute graph similarity, mainly based on the properties of nodes and edges. Interestingly, most of these algorithms ignore the physical location of the nodes, which is a key factor in the context of brain networks involving spatially defined functional areas. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called &amp;#x201C;SimiNet&amp;#x201D; for measuring similarity between two graphs whose nodes are defined a priori within a 3D coordinate system. SimiNet provides a quantified index (ranging from 0 to 1) that accounts for node, edge and spatiality features. Complex graphs were simulated to evaluate the performance of SimiNet that is compared with eight state-of-art methods. Results show that SimiNet is able to detect weak spatial variations in compared graphs in addition to computing similarity using both nodes and edges. SimiNet was also applied to real brain networks obtained during a visual recognition task. The algorithm shows high performance to detect spatial variation of brain networks obtained during a naming task of two categories of visual stimuli: animals and tools. A perspective to this work is a better understanding of object categorization in the human brain.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The massive generation, extensive sharing, and deep exploitation of data in the big data era have raised unprecedented privacy threats. To address privacy concerns, various privacy paradigms have been proposed to achieve a good tradeoff between privacy and data utility. Particularly, differential privacy has been well accepted as one of the de facto standards for privacy preservation, and numerous schemes guaranteeing differential privacy have been proposed. Nonetheless, most of the existing works claiming a superior utility-privacy tradeoff only present specific methods, with distinct perspectives, and a complete comparative analysis and evaluation study has not been fully investigated. To this end, in this paper we review and investigate existing schemes on providing differential privacy from a broad and encompassing perspective to provide a comprehensive survey with respect to both the privacy guarantee and the effectiveness and efficiency in utility improvement. We categorize the existing schemes into distribution optimization, sensitivity calibration, transformation, decomposition, and correlations exploitation, based on their mechanisms in improving data utility. We also conduct some analysis and comparison of their various concepts and principles, focusing on improvements to data utility. Finally, we outline some challenges and provide future research directions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Tensor decomposition is widely used in the analysis of multi-dimensional data. The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) is one of the most popular decomposition methods and commonly found by the CPD-ALS algorithm. High computational and memory costs of CPD-ALS necessitate the use of a distributed-memory-parallel algorithm for efficiency. The medium-grain CPD-ALS algorithm, which adopts multi-dimensional cartesian tensor partitioning, is one of the most successful distributed CPD-ALS algorithms for sparse tensors. This is because cartesian partitioning imposes nice upper bounds on communication overheads. However, this model does not utilize the sparsity pattern of the tensor to reduce the total communication volume. The objective of this work is to fill this literature gap. We propose a novel hypergraph-partitioning model, CartHP, whose partitioning objective correctly encapsulates the minimization of total communication volume of multi-dimensional cartesian tensor partitioning. Experiments on twelve real-world tensors using up to 1024 processors validate the effectiveness of the proposed CartHP model. Compared to the baseline medium-grain model, CartHP achieves average reductions of 52%, 43% and 24% in total communication volume, communication time and overall runtime of CPD-ALS, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The real-world is a medley of multisensory information and so are our experiences, memories and responses. As embodied beings, we respond to the information endogenously and in ways derived from self-defining factors. Thus inspired, we attempt formalization of data-structures to facilitate generation of system-bespoke comprehension-granules of the real-world. Towards this, the structures have been conceptualized to encapsulate multisensory inputs (sourced from the real-world or memories), intrinsic and deliberate emotions, messages (bearing intermittent process-results, queries, multimodal data etc.) across system modules and memory units, and sensorimotor responses to the inputs. The structural-schematics draw insights from the human brain. These variable-length constructs are theoretically platform-independent, support genericity across data-modality and quantity of information inclusion, and provide for representation of novel sensory-data. An epigenome-styled header node for the afferent data-units provides for the activation of intuitive &amp;#x2018;fight-flight&amp;#x2019; behavior. The documentation includes a flow-graph, depicting the translation of information across the data-structures and the different ways of thinking while interpreting a real-world scene or a mind-generated event. Applicability of the structures has been analyzed in the context of comprehension in an embodied mind-machine framework and other similar cognitive frameworks. Studies herein target contribution to the design of generally intelligent man-machine symbiotic systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Narrative collage is an interesting image editing art to summarize the main theme or storyline behind an image collection. We present a novel method to generate narrative images with plausible semantic scene structures. To achieve this goal, we introduce a layer graph and a scene graph to represent relative depth order and semantic relationship between image objects, respectively. We firstly cluster the input image collection to select representative images, and then extract a group of semantic salient objects from each representative image. Both Layer graphs and scene graphs are constructed and combined according to our specific rules for reorganizing the extracted objects in every image. We design an energy model to appropriately locate every object on the final canvas. Experiment results show that our method can produce competitive narrative collage result and works well on a wide range of image collections.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In smart cities, millions of things, systems, and people are interconnected and communicate with each other over wireless sensor networks, Internet of things (IoT), and 5G networks. A tremendous amount of data traffic, which is frequently generated by the things in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) and/or IoT, is accessed by a massive number of mobile users (MUs). These MUs are all competing to access the 5G network for data as well as urban applications and services. This can in turn cause exhaustion to the 5G network. In such cases, users can experience low data delivery and traffic congestions through backhaul links by macro base stations (MBSs). In this paper, we propose a joint caching and downlink resource sharing optimization framework (CSF) in 5G networks to assist WMSNs to efficiently deliver multimedia contents to the MUs. The CSF enables the MBSs to optimally decide how many replicas of each multimedia content to cache in which femto base stations (FBSs) for high multimedia content hit rate. It also optimally exploits the MUs that are willing to share their downlink resources and that have retrieved multimedia contents, for offloading with device-to-device (D2D) communications. The objective is to eventually maximize the system delivery capacity. Simulation results demonstrate that the CSF provides the best performance in terms of hit rate and system delivery capacity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In competitive electricity markets, accurate price forecasting is required to both power producers and consumers for planning their bidding strategies in order to maximize their own benefits. Price classification is an alternative approach to forecasting where the exact values of future prices are not mandatory. Presently, two efficient algorithms are proposed for both short term price forecasting (STPF) and classification (STPC) purposes. The algorithms include various methodologies like wavelet transform (WT), fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FA-PSO) and feed forward neural networks (FFNN). WT is utilized to convert the pathetic price series to an inviolable price series without losing the originality in the signal. Standard PSO (S-PSO) is implemented to tune the fixed architecture FFNN weights and biases. In the present nonlinear problem, linear variation of inertia weight does not resemble exact search process. Hence, dynamic inertia weight is accomplished by implementing the fuzzy systems in the S-PSO approach. The hybrid methodology is implemented on Spanish electricity markets for the year 2002. To validate, three types of price classes and historical price series that are utilized by many researches as input features, are considered. Various statistical indicators are evaluated to compare and validate the proposed approaches with the past approaches available in the literature survey.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), it can be useful to know when a student has disengaged from a task and might benefit from a particular intervention. However, predicting disengagement on a trial-by-trial basis is a challenging problem, particularly in complex cognitive domains. In the present work, data-driven methods were used to address two aspects of this problem: identification of predictive features at the single-trial level, and selection of accurate and robust models. Experiment data were collected in a middle-school classroom using a vocabulary training ITS. On each trial, the ITS presented a low-frequency (Tier 2 or frontier) word and prompted students to type in the word's meaning. Single-trial measures --- including the orthographic and semantic accuracy of each response, and context-sensitive measures such as interaction patterns across trials --- were computed throughout the task. There were two key findings. First, as expected, different features predicted when a student was likely to be more engaged (e.g., high semantic accuracy) or less engaged (e.g., repetition of same or similar words across consecutive trials). Second, there was added value in representing context-sensitive information, which captures patterns of performance over time, as well as trial-specific information. These findings provide useful insights into effective methods for representing and modeling temporal patterns of student engagement in an ITS, especially those related to language learning. Such models may be useful in the design and implementation of adaptive tutors in complex cognitive domains like language learning.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In recent years, there has been a proliferation of interest in resilience in the supply chain field. Even though literature has acknowledged the antecedents of resilient supply chains, such as supply chain visibility, cooperation, and information sharing, their confluence in creating resilient supply chains where other behavioral issues are prevailing (i.e., trust and behavioral uncertainty) has not been studied. To address this gap, we conceptualized a theoretical framework firmly grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) and the relational view that is tested for 250 manufacturing firms using hierarchical moderated regression analysis. The study offers a nuanced understanding of supply chain resilience and implications of supply chain visibility, cooperation, trust, and behavioral uncertainty. Implications and suggestions for further research are provided.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Bedside caregivers assess infants' pain at constant intervals by observing specific behavioral and physiological signs of pain. This standard has two main limitations. The first limitation is the intermittent assessment of pain, which might lead to missing pain when the infants are left unattended. Second, it is inconsistent since it depends on the observer's subjective judgment and differs between observers. The intermittent and inconsistent assessment can induce poor treatment and, therefore, cause serious long-term consequences. To mitigate these limitations, the current standard can be augmented by an automated system that monitors infants continuously and provides quantitative and consistent assessment of pain. Several automated methods have been introduced to assess infants' pain automatically based on analysis of behavioral or physiological pain indicators. This paper comprehensively reviews the automated approaches (i.e., approaches to feature extraction) for analyzing infants' pain and the current efforts in automatic pain recognition. In addition, it reviews the databases available to the research community and discusses the current limitations of the automated pain assessment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the increase in the dependency of our life on technology and data, smart spaces have become integral in providing an environment for data collection, analysis, and machine responses. This paper discusses the current research in this field and the challenges that arise in the execution of these smart spaces. We address the major challenges of hardware design, data analysis and energy efficiency in a new data aware smart environment that collects time-stamped data for position, movement, temperature and vibration sensors. Data collected from these sensors is used to achieve energy efficiency, for real time localization in conjunction with machine learning mechanisms to analyze human activities. We evaluate six different machine learning algorithms for human activity detection task, on a data set collected in our lab. Results show high classification performance for all methods giving up-to 99.95% classification accuracy. We also implemented energy-efficiency measures, leading to up to 30% energy efficiency improvement on top of our initial design. This ambient environment, along with data analytics and improved energy efficiency, provides information regarding the occupancy and behavior of people within its range. Spaces such as conference rooms, common areas such as libraries, classrooms, and even public spaces such as public transport can benefit from our design. Our system avoids privacy issues by using no audio/visual devices. This system thus provides an insight into smart spaces, their current trends, and what future direction research such as ours would lead them to.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>All large scale online video systems, e.g., Netflix and Youku, make a significant investment on video recommendations that can dramatically affect video information diffusion processes among users. However, there is a lack of efficient methodology to interpret how various recommendation mechanisms affect information diffusion processes resulting in the difficulty to evaluate video recommendation efficiency. In this work, we propose to quantify and explain video recommendation mechanisms by using epidemic models to mine video view count traces. It is well known that an epidemic model is an efficient approach to model information diffusion processes; while view count traces can be viewed as the results of video information diffusion driven by video recommendations. Thus, we propose a framework based on extended epidemic models to quantify and interpret two recommendation mechanisms, i.e., direct and word-of-mouth (WOM) recommendations, by fitting video view count traces collected from Tencent Video, a large scale online video system in China. Our approach is a novel methodology to evaluate video recommendation mechanisms, and a new perspective to interpret how recommendation mechanisms drive view count evolution.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The next-generation wireless networks are evolving into very complex systems because of the very diversified service requirements, heterogeneity in applications, devices, and networks. The network operators need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures. Traditional networking approaches, i.e., reactive, centrally-managed, one-size-fits-all approaches and conventional data analysis tools that have limited capability (space and time) are not competent anymore and cannot satisfy and serve that future complex networks regarding operation and optimization cost-effectively. A novel paradigm of proactive, self-aware, selfadaptive and predictive networking is much needed. The network operators have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic exploitation of the big data dramatically helps in making the system smart, intelligent, and facilitates efficient as well as cost-effective operation and optimization. We envision data-driven next-generation wireless networks, where the network operators employ advanced data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics, and the role of machine learning, artificial intelligence in making the system intelligent regarding being self-aware, selfadaptive, proactive and prescriptive. A set of network design and optimization schemes are presented concerning data analytics. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and benefits of adopting big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in the next-generation communication systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>An intelligent carpool system provides people the convenient use of carpool services. In this paper, we take into consideration the time factor of the carpool service problem (CSP) by both the appearance time and the endurance time. The carpool service problem with time windows disfavors carpool solutions in which people show up within a time out. An ant path-oriented carpooling allocation approach is proposed to solve this problem in the time domain. The experimental section presents the environment and results for the proposed approach and three compared approaches, including assignment-based ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing. Here, we are interested in comparing the performance of these approaches with path-based and Assignment-based representations. For each tested benchmark, we compare two objective functions: a primary objective that maximizes the total amount of matched passengers and seat usage rates (SURs), and a secondary objective that reduces users&amp;#x2019; distances as much as possible. The values are presented in the experimental section, and through them we demonstrate that our approach obtains notable performance results against the others.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This work proposes novel hybrid mixed-membership blockmodels (HMMB) that integrate three canonical network models to capture the characteristics of real-world interactions: community structure with mixed-membership, power-law-distributed node degrees, and sparsity. This hybrid model provides the capacity needed for realism, enabling control and inference on individual attributes of interest such as mixed-membership and popularity. A rigorous inference procedure is developed for estimating the parameters of this model through iterative Bayesian updates, with targeted initialization to improve identifiability. For the estimation of mixed-membership parameters, the Cram&amp;#x00E9;r-Rao bound is derived by quantifying the information content in terms of the Fisher information matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed inference is demonstrated in simulations where the estimates achieve covariances close to the Cram&amp;#x00E9;r-Rao bound while maintaining good truth coverage. We illustrate the utility of the proposed model and inference procedure in the application of detecting a community from a few cue nodes, where success depends on accurately estimating the mixed-memberships. Performance evaluations on both simulated and real-world data show that inference with HMMB is able to recover mixed-memberships in the presence of challenging community overlap, leading to significantly improved detection performance over algorithms based on network modularity and simpler models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>All kinds of software projects, whether open or closed source, rely on open source components. Repositories that serve open source components to organizations, such as the Central Repository and npmjs.org, report billions of requests per year. Despite the widespread reliance of projects on open source components, little is known about the social interactions that occur between developers of a project using a component and developers of the component itself. In this paper, we investigate the social interactions that occur for 5,133 pairs of projects, from two different communities (Java and Ruby) representing user projects that depend on a component project. We consider such questions as how often are there social interactions when a component is used? When do the social interactions occur? And, why do social interactions occur? Our results provide insight into how socio-technical interactions occur beyond the level of an individual or small group of projects previously studied by others and identify the need for a new model of socio-technical congruence for dependencies between, instead of within, projects.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Collaborative filtering is widely used in recommendation systems. A user can get high-quality recommendations only when both the user himself/herself and other users actively participate, i.e., provide sufficient ratings. However, due to the rating cost, rational users tend to provide as few ratings as possible. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between the rating cost and the recommendation quality. In this paper, we model the interactions among users as a game in satisfaction form and study the corresponding equilibrium, namely satisfaction equilibrium (SE). Considering that accumulated ratings are used for generating recommendations, we design a behavior rule which allows users to achieve an SE via iteratively rating items. We theoretically analyze under what conditions an SE can be learned via the behavior rule. Experimental results on Jester and MovieLens data sets confirm the analysis and demonstrate that, if all users have moderate expectations for recommendation quality and satisfied users are willing to provide more ratings, then all users can get satisfying recommendations without providing many ratings. The SE analysis of the proposed game in this paper is helpful for designing mechanisms to encourage user participation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vehicular users are emerging as a prime market for targeted advertisement, where advertisements (ads) are sent from network points of access to vehicles, and displayed to passengers only if they are relevant to them. In this study, we take the viewpoint of a broker managing the advertisement system, and getting paid every time a relevant ad is displayed to an interested user. The broker selects the ads to broadcast at each point of access so as to maximize its revenue. In this context, we observe that choosing the ads that best fit the users&amp;#x0027; interest could actually hurt the broker&amp;#x0027;s revenue. In light of this conflict, we present Volfied, an algorithm allowing for conflict-free, near-optimal ad selection with very low computational complexity. Our performance evaluation, carried out through real-world vehicular traces, shows that Volfied increases the broker revenue by up to 70% with provably low computational complexity, compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>As a typical scheduling problem, the vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) plays a significant role in public transportation systems. VSP is difficult to solve since it classified as a high-dimensional combination optimization problem, which is well known as an NP-hard problem. Although existing studies on VSP usually assume that all factors in the problem are deterministic and known in advance, various uncertain factors are always present in practical applications, in particular uncertain processing time. In this paper, we consider the problem of VSP with uncertain processing time. In order to solve this problem, a hybrid cooperative co-evolution algorithm (hccEA) is proposed. First, we design two-phase encoding and decoding mechanisms with the aim to search a larger solution space and filter infeasible solutions for genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Second, to overcome performance degradation due to high-dimensional variables, a modified PSO is embedded into the cooperative co-evolution framework, which is called ccPSO. Third, a self-adaptive mechanism for parameters of PSO is proposed to balance the uncertain factors. Then, GA and ccPSO work alternately in an iterative way. Finally, numerical experiments under an uncertain environment verify the superiority of the proposed hccEA based on comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper, we deal with the problem of inferring causal relations for multidimensional data. Based on the postulate that the distribution of the cause and the conditional distribution of the effect given cause are generated independently, we show that the covariance matrix of the mean embedding of the cause in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is free independent with the covariance matrix of the conditional embedding of the effect given cause. This, called freeness condition, induces a cause-effect asymmetry that a designed measurement is $0$ in the causal direction but smaller than $0$ in the anticausal direction, and it uncovers the causal direction. One important novel aspect of this paper is that we interpret the independence as a freeness condition between covariance matrices of RKHS distribution embeddings, and it has a wide applicability. We show that our freeness condition-based inference method succeeds in scenarios like additive noise cases, where other methods fail, by theoretical analysis and experimental results.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With wide use of cloud computing and storage services, sensitive information is increasingly centralized into the cloud to reduce the management costs, which raises concerns about data privacy. Encryption is a promising way to maintain the confidentiality of outsourced sensitive data, but it makes effective data utilization to be a very challenging task. In this paper, we focus on the problem of private matching over outsourced encrypted datasets in identity-based cryptosystem that can simplify the certificate management. To solve this problem, we propose an Identity-Based Private Matching scheme (IBPM), which realizes fine-grained authorization that enables the privileged cloud server to perform private matching operations without leaking any private data. We present the rigorous security proof under the Decisional Linear Assumption and Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Assumption. Furthermore, through the analysis of the asymptotic complexity and the experimental evaluation, we verify that the cost of our IBPM scheme is linear to the size of the dataset and it is more efficient than the existing work of Zheng [30]. Finally, we apply our IBPM scheme to build two efficient schemes, including identity-based fuzzy private matching as well as identity-based multi-keyword fuzzy search.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Since virtual identities such as social media profiles and avatars have become a common venue for self-expression, it has become important to consider the ways in which existing systems embed the values of their designers. In order to design virtual identity systems that reflect the needs and preferences of diverse users, understanding how virtual identity construction differs between groups is important. This paper presents a new methodology that leverages deep learning and differential clustering for comparative analysis of profile images, with a case study of almost 100,000 avatars from a large online community using a popular avatar creation platform. We use novelty discovery to segment the avatars, then cluster avatars by region to identify visual trends among low- and high-novelty avatars. We find that avatar customization correlates with increased social activity, and we are able to identify distinct visual trends among U.S.-region and Japan-region profiles. Among these trends, realistic, idealistic, and creative self-representation can be distinguished. We observe that realistic self-expression mirrors regional demographics, idealistic self-expression reflects shared mass-media tropes, and creative self-expression propagates within communities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Predicting the passenger flow of public transport in a newly developed area of a city is very urgent for designing a precise and efficient public transport network. This paper proposes a new prediction model by exploring the relationship between the passenger flow of a station and its surrounding area's factors. First, in order to obtain more accurate factors affecting the passenger flow, the city is divided into multiple regions with similar internal traffic properties and moderate spatial size using the data of urban road network and buildings. Second, to effectively solve the problem of fuzziness of the station's attraction scope, the concept of the membership degree and fuzzy processing method is proposed. Finally, the station's passenger flow prediction model is launched based on Xgboost. The experimental results on three districts in Beijing show that our method outperforms all baselines significantly which improves the accuracy by more than 20%.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Big data is becoming a research focus in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can be seen in many projects around the world. Intelligent transportation systems will produce a large amount of data. The produced big data will have profound impacts on the design and application of intelligent transportation systems, which makes ITS safer, more efficient, and profitable. Studying big data analytics in ITS is a flourishing field. This paper first reviews the history and characteristics of big data and intelligent transportation systems. The framework of conducting big data analytics in ITS is discussed next, where the data source and collection methods, data analytics methods and platforms, and big data analytics application categories are summarized. Several case studies of big data analytics applications in intelligent transportation systems, including road traffic accidents analysis, road traffic flow prediction, public transportation service plan, personal travel route plan, rail transportation management and control, and assets maintenance are introduced. Finally, this paper discusses some open challenges of using big data analytics in ITS.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Unsupervised hashing can desirably support scalable content-based image retrieval for its appealing advantages of semantic label independence, memory, and search efficiency. However, the learned hash codes are embedded with limited discriminative semantics due to the intrinsic limitation of image representation. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel hashing approach, dubbed as discrete semantic transfer hashing (DSTH). The key idea is to directly augment the semantics of discrete image hash codes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end, a unified hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Furthermore, to guarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss, we explicitly impose the discrete constraint, bit-uncorrelation constraint, and bit-balance constraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method based on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the optimization problem. The whole learning process has linear computation complexity and desirable scalability. Experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of DSTH compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recently, the internet-of-things (IoT) has emerged as a new paradigm with an ever-increasing number of things to be connected to the internet. Different from the conventional paradigms, in the IoT the data computing scheme is needed to efficiently collect and offer data to provide sensing service. However, the existing data computing schemes are unfriendly which lack the integrated and incentive consideration to reduce the cost of data collection and encourage more participants for cooperation. Therefore, in this paper we propose a utility-based data computing scheme which allows vehicles to collect mobile data in the urban area, in order to provide sensing service in the IoT. Firstly, we present an integrated architecture by introducing roadside buffers where each buffer can have a sink node to collect sensor data from vehicles. Next, by considering both the time cost and power cost during the data collection, we make the analysis of utilities in data computing process. Then, with a bargaining game to model the interaction among participants, a utility based data computing scheme is proposed with incentives where the optimal price can be determined for sensing service. Finally, extensive simulation experiments prove that the proposed scheme can efficiently improve the sensing service in IoT with a low cost.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the explosive growth of services, including Web services, cloud services, APIs and mashups, discovering the appropriate services for consumers is becoming an imperative issue. The traditional service discovery approaches mainly face two challenges: 1) the single source of description documents limits the effectiveness of discovery due to the insufficiency of semantic information; 2) more factors should be considered with the generally increasing functional and nonfunctional requirements of consumers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called SMS, for effectively discovering the appropriate services by incorporating social media information. Specifically, we present different methods to measure four social factors (semantic similarity, popularity, activity, decay factor) collected from Twitter. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) model is applied to mine semantic information of services from meta-data of Twitter Lists that contains them. In addition, we assume the target query-service matching function as a linear combination of multiple social factors and design a weight learning algorithm to learn an optimal combination of the measured social factors. Comprehensive experiments based on a real-world dataset crawled from Twitter demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework SMS, through some compared approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Smart phones nowadays are equipped with GPS chips to enable navigation and location-based services. A malicious app with the access to GPS data can easily track the person who carries the smart phone. People may disable the GPS module and turn it on only when necessary to protect their location privacy. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that an attacker is still able to track a person by using the embedded magnetometer sensor in victim's smart phone, even when the GPS module is disabled all the time. Moreover, this attack neither requests user permissions related to locations for installation, nor does its operation rely on wireless signals like WiFi positioning or suffer from signal propagation loss. Only the angles of a car's turning measured by the magnetometer sensor of a driver's smart phone are utilized. Without loss of generality, we focus on car tracking, since cars are popular transportation tools in developed countries, where smart phones are commonly used. Inspired by the intuition that a car may exhibit different turning angles at different road intersections, we find that an attacker can match car turning angles to a map to infer the actual path that the driver takes. We address technical challenges about car turn angle extraction, map database construction, and path matching algorithm design to make this attack practical and efficient. We also perform an evaluation using real-world driving paths to verify the relationship between the numbers of turns and the time cost of the matching algorithm. The results show that it is possible for attacker to precisely pinpoint the actual path when the driving path includes 11 turns or more. More simulations are performed to demonstrate the attack with lager selected local areas.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a principled approach to the modeling of human drivers--applied to stop behavior--by uniting recent ideas in cognitive science and optimal control. With respect to the former, we invoke the affordance competition hypothesis, according to which human behavior is produced by resolving the competition between action affordances that are simultaneously instantiated in response to the environment. From the theory of optimal control, we deploy motor primitives based on minimum jerk as the potential suite of actions. Furthermore, we invoke a layered control architecture, which carries out action priming and action selection sequentially, to model the biological affordance competition process. Motor output may be directed to distinct motor channels, which may be partially inhibited, e.g., to model gas pedal release saturation. Within this architecture, two types of motor units--'deceleration' acting on a gas pedal channel and 'brake' acting on a brake pedal channel--are sufficient to model, with remarkable accuracy, the various phases that can be observed in human maneuvers in stopping a car, namely: gas release, gas chocked, brake, and final brake release at stop. The model is validated using experimental data collected in 16 different stop locations, from roundabouts to traffic lights. We also carry out a comparison with the well-known Intelligent Driver Model, discuss the scaling of this framework to more general driving scenarios and finally give an example application where the driver model is used, within a mirroring process, to infer the human driver intentions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The large quantity of mobile devices equipped with various built-in sensors and the easy access to the high-speed wireless networks have made spatial crowdsourcing receive much attention in the research community recently. Generally, the objective of spatial crowdsourcing is to outsource location-based sensing tasks (e.g., traffic monitoring and pollution monitoring) to ordinary mobile workers (e.g., users carrying smartphones) efficiently. In this paper, we study a reliable task assignment problem for spatial crowdsourcing in a large worker market. Specifically, we use worker confidence to represent the reliability of successfully completing the assigned sensing tasks, and we formulate two optimization problems, maximum reliability assignment (MRA) under a recruitment budget and minimum cost assignment (MCA) under a task reliability requirement. We reveal the special structure properties of these problems, based on which we design effective approaches to assign tasks to the most suitable workers. The performances of the proposed algorithms are verified by theoretic analysis and experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>One of the keys to making cloud data-centers (CDCs) proliferate impressively is the implementation of efficient task scheduling. Since all the resources of CDCs, even including operating systems (OSes) and application programs, can be stored and managed on remote data-centers, this study first analyzed the task scheduling problem for CDCs and established a mathematical model of the scheduling of two-stage tasks. The Johnson&amp;#x2019;s rule was combined with the genetic algorithm to create a Johnson&amp;#x2019;s-rule-based genetic algorithm (JRGA), which takes into account the characteristics of multiprocessor scheduling in CDCs. New crossover and mutation operations were devised to make the algorithm converge more quickly. In the decoding process, the Johnson&amp;#x2019;s rule is used to optimize the makespan for each machine. Simulations were used to compare the performance of the JRGA with that of the list scheduling algorithm and an improved list scheduling algorithm. The results demonstrate the validity of the JRGA.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>One-class support vector machines (OCSVMs) are very effective for semisupervised anomaly detection. However, their performance strongly depends on the settings of their hyperparameters, which has not been well studied. Moreover, unavailability of a clean training set that only comprises normal data in many real-life problems has given rise to the application of OCSVMs in an unsupervised manner. However, it has been shown that if the training set includes anomalies, the normal boundary created by OCSVMs is prone to skew toward the anomalies. This problem decreases the detection rate of anomalies and results in poor performance of the classifier. In this paper, we propose a new technique to set the hyperparameters and clean suspected anomalies from unlabelled training sets. The proposed method removes suspected anomalies based on a K-nearest neighbors technique, which is then used to directly estimate the hyperparameters. We examine several benchmark data sets with diverse distributions and dimensionality. Our findings suggest that on the examined data sets, the proposed technique is roughly 70 times faster than supervised parameter estimation via grid-search and cross validation, and one to three orders of magnitude faster than broadly used semisupervised and unsupervised parameter estimation methods for OCSVMs. Moreover, our method statistically outperforms those semisupervised and unsupervised methods and its accuracy is comparable to supervised grid-search and cross validation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The rapid development and penetration of mobile social networking have enabled new-generation video sharing services that use smart mobile terminals to instantly capture and share short video clips (usually of several seconds). The instant video clips are then directly consumed at smart-terminals with specially designed mobile interfaces and operations. A number of mobile apps, e.g., Twitter's Vine, Miaopai, Instagram, and Snapchat, to name but a few, have incorporated such services and seen great acceptance, particularly by the youth community. In this paper, we present an initial study on this new service type. Taking Twitter's Vine as a representative, we systematically investigate its distinct mobile interface, service framework, and user watching behaviors, revealing how this new service type differentiates from its traditional counterparts. Our trace measurement and analysis demonstrate that instant mobile video clips have much shorter lifespan and highly skewed popularity that quickly decays over time. This is further aggravated by the unique screen scrolling operation for video browsing. As such, the download-and-watch scheduling used by existing platforms can hardly achieve quality user experience and cost efficiency. We closely investigate and model the input user gestures for scrolling, including drag and fling, and analyze the scheduling policy, partitioning it into pre-fetching scheduling and watch-time download scheduling. We develop effective solutions towards both subproblems as well as their integration with screen scrolling. The superiority of our enhancement is demonstrated by extensive trace-driven evaluation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Investor sentiment plays an important role on the stock market. User-generated textual content on the Internet provides a precious source to reflect investor psychology and predicts stock prices as a complement to stock market data. This paper integrates sentiment analysis into a machine learning method based on support vector machine. Furthermore, we take the day-of-week effect into consideration and construct more reliable and realistic sentiment indexes. Empirical results illustrate that the accuracy of forecasting the movement direction of the SSE 50 Index can be as high as 89.93&amp;#x0025; with a rise of 18.6&amp;#x0025; after introducing sentiment variables. And, meanwhile, our model helps investors make wiser decisions. These findings also imply that sentiment probably contains precious information about the asset fundamental values and can be regarded as one of the leading indicators of the stock market.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this work, we present a data science system to model and visualize student flow patterns based on electronic student data of a university. Our system is called eCamp. The datasets used by eCamp were previously disconnected and only maintained and accessed in a siloed manner by independent campus offices. At a campus-level, our models and visualization show how students make choices among hundreds of potential majors, as students gradually progress towards their sophomore, junior, and senior year. At a department-level, the student flow patterns revealed by eCamp show how each course plays a different role within a curriculum. eCamp further dives down to the granularity of the exact classes offered in each semester. At that level, eCamp shows how students navigate from one set of classes in one semester to another set in a subsequent semester. Previously, comprehensive information about student progression patterns at all of these level was simply unavailable. To that end, we also demonstrate how insights into such student flow patterns can support analytical tasks involving student outcomes, student retention, and curriculum design.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Software engineering is increasingly concerned with theory because the foundational knowledge comprising theories provides a crucial counterpoint to the practical knowledge expressed through methods and techniques. Fortunately, much guidance is available for generating and evaluating theories for explaining why things happen (variance theories). Unfortunately, little guidance is available concerning theories for explaining how things happen (process theories), or theories for analyzing and understanding situations (taxonomies). This paper therefore attempts to clarify the nature and functions of process theories and taxonomies in software engineering research, and to synthesize methodological guidelines for their generation and evaluation. It further advances the key insight that most process theories are taxonomies with additional propositions, which helps inform their evaluation. The proposed methodological guidance has many benefits: it provides a concise summary of existing guidance from reference disciplines, it adapts techniques from reference disciplines to the software engineering context, and it promotes approaches that better facilitate scientific consensus.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Online social networks have now become the most popular platforms for people to share information with others. Along with this, there is a serious threat to individuals&amp;#x2019; privacy. One privacy risk comes from the sharing of co-owned data, i.e., when a user shares a data item that involves multiple users, some users&amp;#x2019; privacy may be compromised, since different users generally have different opinions on who can access the data. How to design a collaborative management mechanism to deal with such a privacy issue has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we propose a trust-based mechanism to realize collaborative privacy management. Basically, a user decides whether or not to post a data item based on the aggregated opinion of all involved users. The trust values between users are used to weight users&amp;#x2019; opinions, and the values are updated according to users&amp;#x2019; privacy loss. Moreover, the user can make a trade-off between data sharing and privacy preserving by tuning the parameter of the proposed mechanism. We formulate the selecting of the parameter as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply the upper confidence bound policy to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the trust-based mechanism can encourage the user to be considerate of others&amp;#x2019; privacy, and the proposed bandit approach can bring the user a high payoff.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Informal language and the absence of a standard taxonomy for software technologies make it difficult to reliably analyze technology trends on discussion forums and other on-line venues. We propose an automated approach called Witt for the categorization of software technology (an expanded version of the hypernym discovery problem). Witt takes as input a phrase describing a software technology or concept and returns a general category that describes it (e.g., integrated development environment), along with attributes that further qualify it (commercial, php, etc.). By extension, the approach enables the dynamic creation of lists of all technologies of a given type (e.g., web application frameworks). Our approach relies on Stack Overflow and Wikipedia, and involves numerous original domain adaptations and a new solution to the problem of normalizing automatically-detected hypernyms. We compared Witt with six independent taxonomy tools and found that, when applied to software terms, Witt demonstrated better coverage than all evaluated alternate solutions, without a corresponding degradation in false positive rate.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Network Neutrality is becoming increasingly important as the global debate intensifies and governments worldwide implement and withdraw regulations. According to this principle, all Internet traffic must be processed without differentiation, regardless of origin, destination and/or content. Neutrality supporters claim that traffic differentiation can compromise innovation, fair competition and freedom of choice. However, detecting that an ISP is not employing traffic differentiation practices is still a challenge. This work presents a survey of strategies and tools for detecting traffic differentiation on the Internet. After presenting basic neutrality definitions as well as an overview of the worldwide debate, we describe ways that can be used by an ISP to implement traffic differentiation, and define the problem of differentiation detection. This is followed by a description of multiple existing strategies and tools. These solutions differ mainly on how they execute network measurements, the metrics employed, traffic generation techniques, and statistical methods. We also present a taxonomy for the different types of traffic differentiation and the different types of detection. Finally, we identify open challenges and future research directions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Soft-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new approach that enables operators to easily manage all the network elements. In this paper, we address the problem of energy-aware routing in SDN-based carrier-grade Ethernet networks. Our approach is based on turning off network nodes and links to reduce energy consumption, while respecting the rule space capacity for each Openflow switch, and maintaining an allowable maximum link utilization. The problem of identifying the optimal set of network elements to be turned off is NP-hard. We first present an exact model based on an Integer Linear Programming formulation for the problem. Then, we describe a set of first-fit heuristic algorithms suitable for large-sized networks. The exact and heuristic approaches are tested on SNDlib-based instances. Experimentations show the efficiency of both exact and heuristic methods for different network topologies. In particular, our heuristic algorithms are able to achieve a good balance between energy consumption, resource utilization, and network performance.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We present a review of spectrum sharing wireless body area networks. We investigate how cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access are used for body area networks to save spectral resources. Specifically, we study the features associated with the usage of the three major cognitive radio paradigms of underlay, interweave, and overlay in these networks. We further put forward some use cases in medical applications. In this regard, we provide an overview of the existing schemes on interference mitigation for coexistence of different devices involving wireless body area networks. Further, we proceed with existing energy efficient medium access control protocols for cognitive radio-enabled body area networks. In addition, we outline the challenges and obstacles of implementing spectrum sharing concepts for body sensor networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Automatic prediction of the aesthetic quality of a photograph has been an important research problem in image processing and computer vision. While assessing the aesthetic quality of a photograph by human is highly subjective, most existing studies have considered only objective (or general) opinion of multiple viewers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the issue of subjectivity in aesthetic quality assessment using a large-scale database containing photos, user ratings, and user comments. First, we analyze how the mean aesthetic quality level and the level of subjectivity have evolved over time. Second, we examine the feasibility of automatic prediction of the level of subjectivity based on visual features, and identify which features are effective for the prediction. Third, we analyze the users comments given to photos to understand the sources of subjectivity of aesthetic quality rating. Our results show that several factors are simultaneously involved in determining the level of subjectivity of a photo, but it can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. We believe that our results provide insight toward personalized aesthetic photo applications.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The interaction between technology and healthcare has a long history. However, recent years have witnessed the rapid growth and adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the advent of miniature wearable biosensors, and research advances in Big Data techniques for effective manipulation of large, multiscale, multimodal, distributed and heterogeneous data sets. These advances have generated new opportunities for personalized precision eHealth and mHealth services. IoT heralds a paradigm shift in the healthcare horizon by providing many advantages, including availability and accessibility, ability to personalize and tailor content, and cost-effective delivery. Although IoT eHealth has vastly expanded the possibilities to fulfill a number of existing healthcare needs, many challenges must still be addressed in order to develop consistent, suitable, safe, flexible and power-efficient systems that are suitable fit for medical needs. To enable this transformation, it is necessary for a large number of significant technological advancements in the hardware and software communities to come together. This keynote paper addresses all these important aspects of novel IoT technologies for smart healthcare-wearable sensors, body area sensors, advanced pervasive healthcare systems, and Big Data analytics. It identifies new perspectives and highlights compelling research issues and challenges such as scalability, interoperability, device-network-human interfaces, and security, with various case studies. In addition, with the help of examples, we show how knowledge from CAD areas such as large scale analysis and optimization techniques can be applied to the important problems of eHealth.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>DC electric power systems, including HVDC, HVDC Light, dc distribution systems and dc microgrids, have a significant position in present and, especially, future electric power systems, namely smart grids. One of the most significant issues of electric power systems, including dc electric power systems, is the calculation of accurate and fair energy costs of the consumers. In this paper, novel, simple, practical and precise relations between economic and electrical variables in dc electric power systems are extracted. The novel relations prove that there are interesting relations between voltages of nodes, as electrical variables, and prices of nodes, as economic variables, in dc electric power systems. Applying the extracted novel relations in this paper, a new, fair, precise, practical nodal price, i.e., the fair nodal price, is determined to calculate the energy costs of consumers in dc electric power systems, including dc distribution systems and microgrids. Moreover, as an application of the extracted novel relations, a practical method to determine the fair nodal prices of all nodes and, as a result, the real energy cost of each consumer at each node of dc electric power systems is presented. The analyses results demonstrate the mentioned significant characteristics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Firms need to innovate and develop dynamic capabilities to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Due to this pressure, firms in high-tech industries invest a high percentage of their revenues in innovation. Despite the vast number of innovation success stories, only one in five innovation projects reaches the market. It is important to understand the drivers of project termination as many firms make sizable investments in innovation and these drivers may have a significant impact on their innovation performance. Therefore, the earlier recognition of unfeasible projects would avoid continued investment and release resources that could be invested in more profitable projects. This paper investigates firm-level factors influencing the termination of innovation projects based on a sample of 4385 firms in the Czech Republic and Germany. We find that firm size, research and development activities, organizational agility, and the level of internationalization are positively associated with innovation project termination. Surprisingly, marketing innovation is also positively associated with project termination. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of why some firms are better at identifying unsuccessful projects (earlier) than others. Identifying generalizable factors provides complementary insights into project-level factors of project termination that can have a remarkable impact on the profitability and survival of firms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, a lot of people possess accounts on multiple online social networks, e.g., Facebook and Twitter. These networks are overlapped, but the correspondences between their users are not explicitly given. Mapping common users across these social networks will be beneficial for applications such as cross-network recommendation. In recent years, a lot of mapping algorithms have been proposed which exploited social and/or profile relations between users from different networks. However, there is still a lack of unified mapping framework which can well exploit high-order relational information in both social structures and profiles. In this paper, we propose a unified hypergraph learning framework named unified manifold alignment on hypergraph (UMAH) for this task. UMAH models social structures and user profile relations in a unified hypergraph where the relative weights of profile hyperedges are determined automatically. Given a set of training user correspondences, a common subspace is learned by preserving the hypergraph structure as well as the correspondence relations of labeled users. UMAH intrinsically performs semisupervised manifold alignment with profile information for calibration. For a target user in one network, UMAH ranks all the users in the other network by their probabilities of being the corresponding user (measured by similarity in the subspace). In experiments, we evaluate UMAH on three real world data sets and compare it to state-of-art baseline methods. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of UMAH in mapping users across networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We review the research literature investigating systems in which mobile entities can carry data while they move. These entities can be either mobile by nature (e.g., human beings and animals) or mobile by design (e.g., trains, airplanes, and cars). The movements of such entities equipped with storage capabilities create a communication channel which can help overcome the limitations or the lack of conventional data networks. Common limitations include the mismatch between the capacity offered by these networks and the traffic demand or their limited deployment owing to environmental factors. Application scenarios include offloading traffic off legacy networks for capacity improvement, bridging connectivity gaps, or deploying ad hoc networks in challenging environments for coverage enhancement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Revealing complex relations between entities (e.g., items within or between transactions) is of great significance for business optimization, prediction, and decision making. Such relations include not only co-occurrence-based explicit relations but also nonco-occurrence-based implicit ones. Explicit relations have been substantially studied by rule mining-based approaches, including association rule mining and causal rule discovery. In contrast, implicit relations have received much less attention but could be more actionable. In this paper, we focus on the implicit relations between items which rarely or never co-occur while each of them co-occurs with other identical items (link items) with a high probability. A framework integrates both explicit and hidden item dependencies and a corresponding efficient algorithm IRRMiner captures such implicit relations with implicit rule inference. Experimental results show that IRRMiner not only infers implicit rules of various sizes consisting of both frequent and infrequent items effectively, it also runs at least four times faster than IARMiner, a typical indirect association rule mining algorithm which can only mine size-2 indirect association rules between frequent items. IRRMiner is applied to make recommendations and shows that the identified implicit rules can increase recommendation reliability.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Hadoop and Spark are widely used distributed processing frameworks for large-scale data processing in an efficient and fault-tolerant manner on private or public clouds. These big-data processing systems are extensively used by many industries, e.g., Google, Facebook, and Amazon, for solving a large class of problems, e.g., search, clustering, log analysis, different types of join operations, matrix multiplication, pattern matching, and social network analysis. However, all these popular systems have a major drawback in terms of locally distributed computations, which prevent them in implementing geographically distributed data processing. The increasing amount of geographically distributed massive data is pushing industries and academia to rethink the current big-data processing systems. The novel frameworks, which will be beyond state-of-the-art architectures and technologies involved in the current system, are expected to process geographically distributed data at their locations without moving entire raw datasets to a single location. In this paper, we investigate and discuss challenges and requirements in designing geographically distributed data processing frameworks and protocols. We classify and study batch processing (MapReduce-based systems), stream processing (Spark-based systems), and SQL-style processing geo-distributed frameworks, models, and algorithms with their overhead issues.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recent expansions of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applying cloud computing have been growing at a phenomenal rate. As one of the developments, heterogeneous cloud computing has enabled a variety of cloud-based infrastructure solutions, such as multimedia big data. Numerous prior researches have explored the optimizations of on-premise heterogeneous memories. However, the heterogeneous cloud memories are facing constraints due to the performance limitations and cost concerns caused by the hardware distributions and manipulative mechanisms. Assigning data tasks to distributed memories with various capacities is a combinatorial NP-hard problem. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a novel approach, Cost-Aware Heterogeneous Cloud Memory Model (CAHCM), aiming to provision a high performance cloud-based heterogeneous memory service offerings. The main algorithm supporting CAHCM is Dynamic Data Allocation Advance (2DA) Algorithm that uses genetic programming to determine the data allocations on the cloud-based memories. In our proposed approach, we consider a set of crucial factors impacting the performance of the cloud memories, such as communication costs, data move operating costs, energy performance, and time constraints. Finally, we implement experimental evaluations to examine our proposed model. The experimental results have shown that our approach is adoptable and feasible for being a cost-aware cloud-based solution.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Rapid urbanization has posed significant burden on urban transportation infrastructures. In today&amp;#x0027;s cities, both private and public transits have clear limitations to fulfill passengers&amp;#x0027; needs for quality of experience (QoE): Public transits operate along fixed routes with long wait time and total transit time; Private transits, such as taxis, private shuttles and ride-hailing services, provide point-to-point transits with high trip fare. In this paper, we propose CityLines, a transformative urban transit system, employing hybrid hub-and-spoke transit model with shared shuttles. Analogous to Airlines services, the proposed CityLines system routes urban trips among spokes through a few hubs or direct paths, with travel time as short as private transits and fare as low as public transits. CityLines allows both point-to-point connection to improve the passenger QoE, and hub-and-spoke connection to reduce the system operation cost. To evaluate the performance of CityLines, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using one-month real-world trip demand data (from taxis, buses and subway trains) collected from Shenzhen, China. The results demonstrate that CityLines reduces 12.5%-44% average travel time, and aggregates 8.5%-32.6% more trips with ride-sharing over other implementation baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Distance metric learning plays a crucial role in diverse machine learning algorithms and applications. When the labeled information in a target domain is limited, transfer metric learning (TML) helps to learn the metric by leveraging the sufficient information from other related domains. Multitask metric learning (MTML), which can be regarded as a special case of TML, performs transfer across all related domains. Current TML tools usually assume that the same feature representation is exploited for different domains. However, in real-world applications, data may be drawn from heterogeneous domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches can be adopted to remedy this drawback by deriving a metric from the learned transformation across different domains. However, they are often limited in that only two domains can be handled. To appropriately handle multiple domains, we develop a novel heterogeneous MTML (HMTML) framework. In HMTML, the metrics of all different domains are learned together. The transformations derived from the metrics are utilized to induce a common subspace, and the high-order covariance among the predictive structures of these domains is maximized in this subspace. There do exist a few heterogeneous transfer learning approaches that deal with multiple domains, but the high-order statistics (correlation information), which can only be exploited by simultaneously examining all domains, is ignored in these approaches. Compared with them, the proposed HMTML can effectively explore such high-order information, thus obtaining more reliable feature transformations and metrics. Effectiveness of our method is validated by the extensive and intensive experiments on text categorization, scene classification, and social image annotation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The issue of selecting the optimal defense strategy in the dynamic adversarial network is difficult. To solve this problem, we start from the realistic bounded rationality of both the attacker and the defender. Firstly, we build the Bayesian attack-defense evolutionary game model combining with incomplete information game scenario. Specifically, we convert the uncertainty of the strategy payoffs of attackers and defenders to the uncertainty of their related types. Meanwhile, both the set of player types and the set of game strategies can be expanded to n in our model. Furthermore, we improve the replicator dynamics equation by adding the selecting intensity factor to depict the noise effect. This reflects the randomness of decision-making for players due to their bounded learning capacities. In this way, the static analysis in the traditional game is extended as a dynamic process. On this basis, we summarize the evolutions of different player types with different strategies. Finally, by calculating the evolutionary stable equilibrium, we give the algorithm of selecting optimal defense strategy and depict the evolutionary track of this strategy selected by the defender with time going by. Our method provides decision support for the network proactive defense towards moderate security. Moreover, the dynamic analysis efficiency of defense decision-making is improved and the predicting ability of the defense situation is enhanced. Experimental results verify the scientificity and availability of the proposed model and method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Deduplication has become a widely deployed technology in cloud data centers to improve IT resources efficiency. However, traditional techniques face a great challenge in big data deduplication to strike a sensible tradeoff between the conflicting goals of scalable deduplication throughput and high duplicate elimination ratio. We propose AppDedupe, an application-aware scalable inline distributed deduplication framework in cloud environment, to meet this challenge by exploiting application awareness, data similarity and locality to optimize distributed deduplication with inter-node two-tiered data routing and intra-node application-aware deduplication. It first dispenses application data at file level with an application-aware routing to keep application locality, then assigns similar application data to the same storage node at the super-chunk granularity using a handprinting-based stateful data routing scheme to maintain high global deduplication efficiency, meanwhile balances the workload across nodes. AppDedupe builds application-aware similarity indices with super-chunk handprints to speedup the intra-node deduplication process with high efficiency. Our experimental evaluation of AppDedupe against state-of-the-art, driven by real-world datasets, demonstrates that AppDedupe achieves the highest global deduplication efficiency with a higher global deduplication effectiveness than the high-overhead and poorly scalable traditional scheme, but at an overhead only slightly higher than that of the scalable but low duplicate-elimination-ratio approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Fine grained access control is a requirement for data stored in untrusted servers like clouds. Owing to the large volume of data, decentralized key management schemes are preferred over centralized ones. Often encryption and decryption are quite expensive and not practical when users access data from resource constrained devices. We propose a decentralized attribute based encryption (ABE) scheme with fast encryption, outsourced decryption and user revocation. Our scheme is very specific to the context of mobile cloud as the storage of encrypted data and the partial decryption of ciphertexts are dependent on the cloud and users with mobile devices can upload data to the cloud or access data from it by incurring very little cost for encryption and decryption respectively. The main idea is to divide the encryption into two phases, offline preprocessing phase which is done when the device is otherwise not in use and an online phase when the data is actually encrypted with the policy. This makes encryption faster and more efficient than existing decentralized ABE schemes. For decryption outsourcing, data users need to generate a transformed version of the decryption key allowing an untrusted proxy server to partially decrypt the ciphertext without gaining any information about the plaintext. Data users can then fully decrypt the partially decrypted ciphertext without performing any costly pairing operations. We also introduce user revocation in this scheme without incurring too much additional cost in the online phase. Comparison with other ABE schemes shows that our scheme significantly reduces computation times for both data owners and data users and highly suitable for use in mobile devices.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In many applications, Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) must be able to express various affects such as emotions or social attitudes. Non-verbal signals, such as smiles or gestures, contribute to the expression of attitudes. Social attitudes affect the whole behavior of a person: they are &amp;#x201C;characteristic of an affective style that colors the entire interaction&amp;#x201D; (Scherer, 2005). Moreover, recent findings have demonstrated that non-verbal signals are not interpreted in isolation but along with surrounding signals. Non-verbal behavior planning models designed to allow ECAs to express attitudes should thus consider complete sequences of non-verbal signals and not only signals independently of one another. However, existing models do not take this into account, or in a limited manner. The contribution of this paper is a methodology for the automatic extraction of sequences of non-verbal signals characteristic of a social phenomenon from a multimodal corpus, and a non-verbal behavior planning model that takes into account sequences of non-verbal signals rather than signals independently. This methodology is applied to design a virtual recruiter capable of expressing social attitudes, which is then evaluated in and out of an interaction context.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>While social computing related research has focused mostly on how to provide users with more precise and direct information, or on recommending new search methods to find requested information rapidly, the authors believe that network users themselves could be viewed as an important social resource. This study concentrates on analyzing potential and dynamic user correlations, based on topic-aware similarity and behavioral influence, which may help us to discover communities in social networking sites. The dynamically socialized user networking (DSUN) model is extended and refined to represent implicit and explicit user relationships in terms of topic-aware features and social behaviors. A set of measures is defined to describe and quantify interuser correlations, relating to social behaviors. Three types of ties are proposed to describe and discover communities according to influence-based user relationships. Results of the experiment with Twitter data are used to show the discovery of three types of communities, based on the presented model. Comparison with six different schemes and two existing methods demonstrates that the proposed method is effective in discovering influence-based communities. Finally, the scenario-based simulation of collective decision-making processes demonstrates the practicability of the proposed model and method in social interactive systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this article, we propose a novel cooperative hierarchical caching framework in a Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), in which a new cloud-cache at Cloud Processing Unit (CPU) is envisioned to bridge the storage-capacity/delay-performance gap between the traditional edge-based and core-based caching paradigms. A delay-cost model is introduced and the cache-placement problem is formulated that aims at minimizing the average delay-cost of content delivery in the network. Given the NP-completeness of the cache placement problem, we propose a low-complexity heuristic cache-management strategy comprising of a proactive cache-distribution algorithm and a reactive cache-replacement algorithm. Furthermore, a Cache-Aware Request Scheduling (CARS) algorithm is devised in order to optimize online the tradeoff between content download rate and content access delay. Via extensive numerical simulations---carried out using both real-world YouTube video requests and synthetic content requests---it is demonstrated that the proposed cache-management strategy outperforms traditional caching strategies in terms of cache hit ratio, average content access delay, and backhaul traffic load. Additionally, the proposed cache-aware content request scheduling algorithm achieves superior tradeoff performance over traditional approaches that optimize either users&amp;#x0027; rate or access delay alone.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Among the applications of the internet and cloud computing, online social network (OSN) is a very popular service. Since a lot of personal information is stored on the OSN platform, privacy protection on such an application has become a critical issue. Apart from this, OSN platforms need advertisement revenue to enable continued operations. However, if the users encrypt their messages, then OSN providers cannot generate accurate advertisement to users. Thus, how to achieve both privacy preserving and accurate advertisement is a worth-discussing issue. Unfortunately, none of the works on OSNs can achieve both privacy preserving and accurate advertisement simultaneously. In view of this, we propose the first multireceiver predicate encryption scheme for OSN platforms. Not only does the proposed scheme protects the users' privacy but it achieves customized advertisement as well. Compared with other predicate encryptions deployed in OSN platforms, the proposed scheme gains much shorter ciphertext. The semantic security and attribute hiding of the proposed scheme are proved under the standard model.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The stable relationship between personality and EEG ensures the feasibility of personality inference from brain activities. In this paper, we recognize an individual&amp;#x0027;s personality traits by analyzing brain waves when he or she watches emotional materials. Thirty-seven participants took part in this study and watched 7 standardized film clips that characterize real-life emotional experiences and target seven discrete emotions. Features extracted from EEG signals and subjective ratings enter the SVM classifier as inputs to predict five dimensions of personality traits. Our model achieves better classification performance for Extraversion (81.08%), Agreeableness (86.11%), and Conscientiousness (80.56%) when positive emotions are elicited than negative ones, higher classification accuracies for Neuroticism (78.38-81.08%) when negative emotions, except disgust, are evoked than positive emotions, and the highest classification accuracy for Openness (83.78%) when a disgusting film clip is presented. Additionally, the introduction of features from subjective ratings increases not only classification accuracy in all five personality traits (ranging from 0.43% for Conscientiousness to 6.3% for Neuroticism) but also the discriminative power of the classification accuracies between five personality traits in each category of emotion. These results demonstrate the advantage of personality inference from EEG signals over state-of-the-art explicit behavioral indicators in terms of classification accuracy.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Temporal information has been widely used to promote the information retrieval (IR) performance, especially for microblog search which usually prefers the latest news and events. Previous studies mainly focused on incorporating the document-level temporal information into retrieval, while the temporal relevance of each query word was not well investigated. In this paper, we propose a word temporal predictor to characterize the word-level temporal relevance by fine-grained time-aware kernel density estimation over the feedback documents. In addition, we present a fine-grained time-aware framework to integrate the proposed word temporal predictor with the traditional document temporal predictor for retrieval. Finally, we incorporate the framework into two state-of-the-art retrieval models, namely language model (LM) and BM25. The experimental results on the TREC 2011-2014 Microblog collections, show that our proposed word temporal predictor is effective to boost the retrieval performance within both LM and BM25 frameworks. In particular, we achieve significant improvements over the strong baselines with optimized settings in most cases. Furthermore, our fine-grained time-aware models with word temporal predictor are comparable to if not better than the state-of-the-art temporal retrieval models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Collaborative development communities and knowledge sharing communities are highly correlated and mutually complementary. The knowledge sharing between these two types of open source communities can be very beneficial to both of them. However, it is a great challenge to automate this process. Current studies mainly focus on knowledge acquisition in one type of community, and few of them have tackle this problem efficiently. In this paper we take Android Issue Tracker and Stack Overflow as a case to study the mutual knowledge sharing between them. We propose an automatic approach by integrating semantic similarity with temporal locality between Android issues and Stack Overflow posts based on the internal citation-graph to reveal the potential associations between them. Our approach explores the internal citations in communities for closely related posts or issues clustering, exploits the rich semantics in fine-grained information of issues and posts for associations building, and leverages the temporal correlations between issues and posts in-depth for associations ranking. Extensive experiments show that the precision of our approach reaches 62.51% for top 10 recommendations when recommending Stack Overflow posts to Android issues, and 66.83% in reverse.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>information linkage around the Internet. It uses Internationalized Resources Identifier (IRI) which can be referred to external information. Typically, an RDF data is serialized as a large text file which contains millions of relationships. In this work, we propose a framework based on TripleID-Q, for query processing of large RDF data in a GPU. The key elements of the framework are 1) a compact representation suitable for a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and 2) its simple representation conversion method which optimizes the preprocessing overhead. Together with the framework, we propose parallel algorithms which utilize thousands of GPU threads to look for specific data for a given query as well as to perform basic query operations such as union, join, and filter. The TripleID representation is smaller than the original representation 3-4 times. Querying from TripleID using a GPU is up to 108 times faster than using the traditional RDF tool. The speedup can be more than 1,000 times over the traditional RDF store when processing a complex query with union and join of many subqueries.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Context: Mobile computing has emerged as a disruptive technology that has empowered its users with portable, connected and context-aware computation. However, issues such as resource poverty, energy efficiency and specifically data security and privacy represent critical challenges for mobile computing. Objective: The objective of this work is to systematically identify, taxonomically classify and map the state-of-research on adaptive security (a.k.a. self-protection) for mobile computing. Methodology: We followed evidence based software engineering method to conduct a systematic mapping study of 43 qualitatively selected studies - published from 2003 to 2017 - on adaptive security for mobile computing. Results and Conclusions: Classification and mapping of the research highlights three prominent themes that support adaptive security for (i) Mobile Device Data and Resources, (ii) Mobile to Mobile Communication, and (iii) Mobile to Server Communication. Mapping analysis suggests that security of mobile device data and resources is the most researched theme. The mapping study highlights that active and futuristic research are primarily focused on security as a service, whereas; the frequent research challenges relate to self-protecting mobile devices, user-driven privacy decisions and context-aware security. The results of the mapping study facilitate knowledge transfer that can benefit researchers and practitioners to understand the role of adaptive and context-aware security in mobile computing environments.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid development of modern satellite communications, broadband satellite services are experiencing a period of remarkable growth in both the number of users and the available bandwidth. More efficient spectrum management schemes require deeper investigation in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband spectrum. In this paper, we propose a band allocation method for multibeam satellite systems by introducing a market-driven pricing mechanism. Instead of adopting static and fixed band selling, we consider a satellite network operator that utilizes the mode of price bargaining to trade the unused band with terrestrial network operators. By applying market-based mechanism to support satellite spectrum allocation, higher spectrum efficiency can be attained in order for satellite systems to meet the increasing demands for satellite bandwidth at an affordable cost. Besides, for the one-to-many bargaining case without terrestrial operator involved in, a differential spectrum pricing solution is devised to address heterogeneous users&amp;#x2019; spectrum preferences. In a typical price bargaining model, market participants (i.e. terrestrial network operators) are assumed to know exactly their needs dynamically, which is hard to achieve in near real-time; thus, our approach approximates it with a sub-optimal estimation on the network operators&amp;#x2019; benefit threshold. To be specific, we obtain the optimal pricing at every round of bargaining by predicting the overall benefits of terrestrial network operators and reaching the Nash equilibrium. Essential discussions and proofs for the pricing rationality are provided. Numerical results are given to evaluate the impact of the pricing scheme on the profits of satellite systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In mobile opportunistic networks, a common assumption is that nodes are able to complete as much data exchange as needed during a communication opportunity, which is, however, not the case in practice due to limited wireless link bandwidth. Beyond that, the storage capacity at a node is also limited, further impacting the communication efficiency. In this paper, we explore delay sensitive and network resource constrained traffic allocation for mobile D2D crowdsourcing. With the requirement of restricted node storage and link bandwidth, we first formulate a non-linear traffic allocation optimization problem that would be at least as hard as NP-hard. In order to practically solve it, based on the submodular property, we propose an approximation algorithm and a distributed heuristic in the same design principle. We implement the latter on Dell Streak tablets and deploy an experiment with 21 nodes for a period of three weeks. Moreover, we extract the implementation codes from the prototype and run simulations using the Haggle trace to study its performance trend. The experiment and simulation outcomes verify that the proposed mechanisms achieve the close-to-optimal performance with affordable computation complexity, which can be easily implanted in practical network environment.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Knowledge graphs have received intensive research interests. When the labels of most nodes or datapoints are missing, anchor graph and hierarchical anchor graph models can be employed. With an anchor graph or hierarchical anchor graph, we only need to optimize the labels of the coarsest anchors, and the labels of datapoints can be inferred from these anchors in a coarse-tofine manner. The complexity of optimization is therefore reduced to a cubic cost with respect to the number of the coarsest anchors. However, to obtain a high accuracy when a data distribution is complex, the scale of this anchor set still needs to be large, which thus inevitably incurs an expensive computational burden. As such, a challenge in scaling up these models is how to efficiently estimate the labels of these anchors while keeping classification performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that adds an anchor label predictor in the conventional anchor graph and hierarchical anchor graph models. In the proposed approach, the labels of the coarsest anchors are not directly optimized, and instead, we learn a label predictor which estimates the labels of these anchors with their spectral representations. The predictor is optimized with a regularization on all datapoints based on a hierarchical anchor graph, and we show that its solution only involves the inversion of a small-size matrix. Built upon the anchor hierarchy, we design a sparse intra-layer adjacency matrix over these anchors, which can simultaneously accelerate spectral embedding and enhance effectiveness. Our approach is named Faster Learning on Anchor Graph (FLAG) as it improves conventional anchor-graph-based methods in terms of efficiency. Experiments on a variety of publicly available datasets with sizes varying from thousands to millions of samples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper addresses a novel virtual reality (VR) system that is based on the real world in which we live. The ultimate goal is to implement it as though a VR user freely exists in a place. To this end, it is most important to reconstruct a VR space that provides 6 degree-of-freedom (DOFs), namely, yaw, pitch, roll, surge, sway, heave. However, most currently released VR services that are based on the real world limit users&amp;#x0027; movements to 3 DOFs. Even if the services support 6 DOFs, most are highly complex and based on computer graphics (CG). To overcome this problem, we first assume that there is a full Internet of things (IoT) infrastructure for collecting important data for VR space reconstruction. This assumption is realistic because many researchers expect that in the near future, IoT technology will lead to a world that connects not only people to people but also things to things. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system architecture for the VR space that is based on the real world along with the element technologies that constitute the proposed system. This paper also includes a detailed survey of both conventional and emerging studies by other researchers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Semantic annotations play an important role in semantics-aware service discovery, recommendation and composition. While existing approaches and tools focus on facilitating the development of semantic annotations on web services, the validation of the quality of annotations is largely overlooked. Meanwhile, the refinement of semantic annotations mostly goes through manual processes, which not only is time-consuming but also requires significant domain knowledge. To enhance the Quality of Semantic Annotation (QoSA), we have developed a technique to incrementally assess and correct semantic annotations of web services. Aiming at supporting web service interoperation, we have formalized the QoSA of input and output parameters. Based on such formalism, test cases are automatically generated to validate service annotations. Learned semantic instances are then accumulated to iteratively validate semantic annotations of other services. Furthermore, a three-phase optimization methodology including local-feedback, global-feedback, and global-propagate is developed to improve the QoSA by incrementally correcting inaccurate annotations. Experiments over a real-world web services repository have demonstrated that our technique can effectively improve QoSA of services, gaining a 78.68% improvement in input parameters annotations and identifying 36.47% inaccurate output parameters annotations. The proposed technique can be equipped at various service repositories to enhance service discovery and recommendation.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Insurance has been increasingly realized as an important way of investment and risk aversion. Fruitful of insurance products are lunched by insurers, but there is little research on how to make a proper insurance investment plan for a specific policyholder given different kinds of policies. In this paper, we aim to propose a practical approach to multi-policy insurance investment planning with a data-driven model and an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). First, by making use of the insurance data accumulated in the modern financial market, an optimization model about how to choose endowment and hospitalization policies is built to maximize the yearly profit of insurance investment. With the model parameters set according to the real data from insurance market, the resulting plan is practical and individualized. Second, as the optimal solution cannot be achieved by mathematical deduction under this data-driven model, an EDA is introduced. To adapt the EDA for the considered problem, the proposed EDA is mixed with both the continuous and discrete probability distribution models to handle different kinds of variables. In addition, an adaptive scheme for choosing suitable distribution models and an efficient constraint handling strategy are proposed. Experiments under different conditions confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Telehealth has shown potential to improve access to health-care cost-effectively in respiratory illness. However, it has failed to live up to expectation, in part because of poor objective measures of symptoms such as cough events, which could lead to early diagnosis or prevention. Considering the burden that these conditions constitute for national health systems, an effort is needed to foster telehealth potential by developing low cost technology for efficient monitoring and analysis of cough events. This paper, proposes the use of local Hu moments as a robust feature set for automatic cough detection in smartphone-acquired audio signals. The final system feeds a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier with the extracted features. To properly evaluate the system in a diversity of noisy backgrounds, we contaminated real cough audio data with a variety of sounds including noise from both indoor and outdoor environments, and non-cough events (sneeze, laugh, speech, etc.). The created database allows flexible settings of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) levels between background sounds and events (cough and non-cough). This evaluation was complemented using real patient data from an outpatient clinic. The system is able to detect cough events with high sensitivity (up to 88.51%) and specificity (up to 99.77%) in a variety of noisy environments, overcoming other state-of-the-art audio features. Our proposal paves the way for ubiquitous cough monitoring with minimal disruption in daily activities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This work proposes a cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) framework for smart factories which associates the social-network-based physical factory circumference with the cyber control through a visualization interface based on NodeTrix. The NodeTrix representation consisting of adjacency matrices and node-link diagrams has been popularly used in social network analysis. Different from previous works on NodeTrix based on square-shaped matrices, the proposed NodeTrix applies triangle-shaped matrices for visualizing overlapping communities to save the displaying space, and a simulated annealing algorithm is used to reduce the crossings among links and communities. In the CPSS for smart factories, working-in-process (WIP) products are categorized according to their attributes, and are placed at different storage locations for later different production processes. By the NodeTrix-based interface for CPSS, when users with different domains and experiences work together to make instant decisions on production and logistics, the physical production environment will be adjusted accordingly and immediately through technological support of Industry 4.0. Through the interface, the information on locations, parameters, and interoperability of WIP products can be visualized and adjusted in time. By comparison with other works, the proposed representation looks promising in displaying social networks for the CPSS with fewer crossings within a smaller screen space.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Human hand motion analysis is an essential research topic in recent applications, especially for dexterous robot hand manipulation learning from human hand skills. It provides important information about the gestures, tactile, speed and contact force, captured via multiple sensing technologies. This paper introduces a comprehensive survey of current hand motion sensing technologies and analysis approaches in recent emerging applications. Firstly, the nature of human hand motions is discussed in terms of simple motions, such as grasps and gestures, and complex motions, e.g. in-hand manipulations and re-grasps; secondly, different techniques for hand motion sensing, including contact-based and non-contact-based approaches, are discussed with comparisons with their pros and cons; then, the state-of-the-art analysis methods are introduced, with a particular focus on the multimodal hand motion sensing and analysis; finally, cutting-edge applications of hand motion analysis are reviewed, with further discussion on facing challenges and new future directions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Service composition is an important research problem in service computing systems, which combines simple and individual services into composite services to fulfill users&amp;#x2019; complex requirements. Service composition usually consists of four stages, i.e., service discovery, candidate selection, service negotiation and task execution. In self-organising systems, there is the fifth stage of service composition: self-evolution. Most of existing works study only some of the five stages. However, these five stages should be systematically studied so as to develop an integrated and efficient service composition approach. Against this background, this paper proposes an agent-based integrated self-evolving service composition approach. This approach systematically takes the five stages of service composition into consideration. It is also decentralised and self-evolvable. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve almost the same success rates while uses much less communication overhead and time consumption in comparison with three existing representative approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Attack graphs are a powerful tool for security risk assessment by analysing network vulnerabilities and the paths attackers can use to compromise network resources. The uncertainty about the attacker&amp;#x2019;s behaviour makes Bayesian networks suitable to model attack graphs to perform static and dynamic analysis. Previous approaches have focused on the formalization of attack graphs into a Bayesian model rather than proposing mechanisms for their analysis. In this paper we propose to use efficient algorithms to make exact inference in Bayesian attack graphs, enabling the static and dynamic network risk assessments. To support the validity of our approach we have performed an extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with different topologies, showing the computational advantages in terms of time and memory use of the proposed techniques when compared to existing approaches.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A user&amp;#x2019;s localness (i.e., whether a user is a local resident in a city or not) and a venue&amp;#x2019;s local attractiveness (i.e., the likelihood of a venue to attract local people) are important information for many location-based applications related with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), such as participatory sensing, urban planning, traffic control and localized travel recommendations. Previous effort has been devoted to geo-locating users in a city using supervised learning approaches, which depend on the availability of high quality training datasets. However, it is difficult to obtain such training datasets in the real-world CPS applications due to the issue of privacy. In this work, we develop an unsupervised approach, called a Physical-Social-Aware Inference (PSAI) scheme, to jointly infer a user&amp;#x2019;s localness and a venue&amp;#x2019;s local attractiveness by exploring both the physical and social information embedded in the location-based social networks (LBSN). We further implement a parallel PSAI framework on the platform of a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) to enhance its ability to process large-scale data. Our extensive experiments on the real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the PSAI scheme compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the widespread of the Internet, the on-line social network with big data is rapidly developing over time. Many enterprises attempt to develop their business by utilizing the power of on-line social networking platforms. A considerable amount of work has focused on how to select a set of influential users to maximize a kind of positive influence in static social networks. However, networks evolve, and the topological structure changes over time. How to mine and adapt the influencers in a dynamic and large-scale environment becomes a challenging issue. In this paper, a collective intelligence model, i.e., stigmergy-based influencers miner, is proposed to investigate influential nodes in a fully dynamic environment. The proposed model is capable of analysing influential relationships in a social network in decentralized manners and identifying the influencers more efficiently than traditional seed selection algorithms. Moreover, it is capable of adapting the solutions in complex dynamic environments without any interruptions or recalculations. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves better performance than other traditional models in both static and dynamic social networks by considering both efficiency and effectiveness.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Spatial entity descriptions are written in natural language based on the observations and understanding of spatial entities and often contain rich semantic information beyond GIS systems. Therefore, entity descriptions must be related to spatial entities in GIS systems. However, most previous studies of this issue were confined to place-type spatial entities, and other types of instance-level spatial entity matching have rarely been studied. Additionally, existing matching methods require complex semantic analysis and manual feature engineering for the description text. In this paper, we focus on the matching of semantic similarity between spatial entities with rich text attributes and descriptions. We propose a semantic textual similarity matching model that incorporates a hierarchical recurrent structure with a focus on learning low-dimensional semantic vector representations of spatial entities and the corresponding descriptions. The model minimizes the distance between the vectors of matched pairs and maximizes the distance between mismatched pairs of samples. The proposed Siamese Hierarchical Attention Network (SHAN) is trained and evaluated using a geological survey dataset. The results show that the proposed model effectively captures the salient semantic information of spatial entities and the associated descriptions in the matching task and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art matching models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper studies the subspace clustering problem. Given some data points approximately drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to group these data points into their underlying subspaces. Many subspace clustering methods have been proposed and among which sparse subspace clustering and low-rank representation are two representative ones. Despite the different motivations, we observe that many existing methods own the common block diagonal property, which possibly leads to correct clustering, yet with their proofs given case by case. In this work, we consider a general formulation and provide a unified theoretical guarantee of the block diagonal property. The block diagonal property of many existing methods falls into our special case. Second, we observe that many existing methods approximate the block diagonal representation matrix by using different structure priors, e.g., sparsity and low-rankness, which are indirect. We propose the first block diagonal matrix induced regularizer for directly pursuing the block diagonal matrix. With this regularizer, we solve the subspace clustering problem by Block Diagonal Representation (BDR), which uses the block diagonal structure prior. The BDR model is nonconvex and we propose an alternating minimization solver and prove its convergence. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BDR.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Feature selection plays a significant role in dealing with high-dimensional data to avoid the curse of dimensionality. In many real applications, like video semantic recognition, handling few labeled and large unlabeled data samples from the same population is a recently addressed challenge in feature selection. To solve this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised feature selection method via insensitive sparse regression (ISR). Specifically, we compute the soft label matrix by the special label propagation, which can predict the labels of the unlabeled data. To guarantee the robustness of ISR to the false labeled instances or outliers, we propose Insensitive Regression Model (IRM) by capped &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$l_{2}-l_{p}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;-norm loss. The soft label is imposed as the weights of IRM to fully utilize the label information. Meanwhile, to perform feature selection, we incorporate &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$l_{2,q}$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;-norm regularizer with IRM as the structural sparsity constraint when &lt;formula&gt;&lt;tex&gt;$0&amp;lt;qleq 1$&lt;/tex&gt;&lt;/formula&gt;. Moreover, we put forward an effective approach for solving the formulated non-convex optimization problem. We analyze the performance of convergence rigorously and discuss the parameter determination problem. Extensive experimental results on several public data sets verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison with the state-of-art feature selection methods. Finally, we apply our method to video semantic recognition successfully.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The physical attributes of the dynamic vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) propagation channel can be utilised for the generation of highly random and symmetric cryptographic keys. However, in a physical-layer key agreement scheme, non-reciprocity due to inherent channel noise and hardware impairments can propagate bit disagreements. This has to be addressed prior to the symmetric key generation which is inherently important in social Internet of Things (IoT) networks, including in adversarial settings (e.g. battlefields). In this paper, we parametrically incorporate temporal variability attributes, such as three-dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers&amp;#x2019; mobility. Accordingly, this is the first work to incorporate such features into the key generation process by combining non-reciprocity compensation with turbo codes. Preliminary results indicate a significant improvement when using Turbo Codes in bit mismatch rate (BMR) and key generation rate (KGR) in comparison to sample indexing techniques.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>During the last two decades, many multioperator- and multimethod-based evolutionary algorithms for solving optimization problems have been proposed. Although, in general terms, they outperform single-operator-based traditional ones, they do not perform consistently for all the problems tested in the literature. The designs of such algorithms usually follow a trial and error approach that can be improved by using a rule-based approach. In this paper, we propose a new way for two algorithms to cooperate as an effective team, in which a heuristic is applied using fuzzy rules of two complementary characteristics, the quality of solutions and diversity in the population. In this process, two subpopulations are used, one for each algorithm, with greater emphasis placed on the better-performing one. Inferior algorithms learn from trusted ones and a fine-tuning procedure is applied in the later stages of the evolutionary process. The proposed algorithm was analyzed on the CEC2014 unconstrained problems and then tested on other three sets (CEC2013, CEC2005, and 12 classical problems), with its results showing a high success rate and that it outperformed both single-operator-based and different state-of-the-art algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Nowadays, ubiquitous computing has radically changed the way users access and interact with services and contents on the Internet: novel smart mobile devices and broadband wireless communication channels allow users to seamlessly access them anytime and anywhere. Middleware infrastructures to support ubiquitous computing need to support an extremely dynamic and ever-changing scenario, where novel contents/services, devices, formats, and media channels become available. Service-oriented architectures and service composition techniques have proven to be the key in designing flexible and extensible platforms able to reliably support ubiquitous computing. However, current trends in service composition for ubiquitous computing tend to be either too formal and therefore poorly usable by average final users, or too vertical and poorly flexible and extensible. This paper proposes a novel service composition middleware for ubiquitous computing that relies on a translucent composition model to achieve a flexible, extensible, highly-available, but also easily understandable and usable platform. The proposed system has been widely tested, benchmarked, and deployed on a number of different and heterogeneous ubiquitous scenarios.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Determining the Nash equilibria (NEs) in a competitive electricity market is a challenging economic game problem. Although finding one equilibrium has been well studied, detecting multiple ones is more practical and difficult, with a few attempts to solve such discrete game problems. However, most of the real-life game problems, such an energy market is a continuous one containing infinite sets of strategy that can be adopted by each player. Therefore, in this paper, a co-evolutionary approach is proposed for detecting multiple NEs in a single run involving continuous games among N-players. Five standard test functions and three IEEE energy market problems in three different scenarios are solved, and their results are compared with those obtained from state-of-the-art algorithms. The results clearly show the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of both the quality of solutions and efficiency.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Improving classification accuracy of motor imagery-based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) systems has been discussed widely in the BCI research community. Analyses of multi-class MI data are challenging because feature extraction and classification of these data are more difficult as compared with those applied to binary-class data. This paper introduces a new model for multi-class MI-BCI data classification. The approach encompasses two main stages: feature extraction and fuzzy classification. In the feature extraction phase, a common spatial pattern algorithm is employed to extract significant discriminant features from the multi-class data. The obtained features serve as inputs to a fuzzy classifier that is designed by fusing the fuzzy standard additive model and particle swarm optimization method. The proposed fuzzy model aims to handle uncertainty, noise, and outliers existed in MI-BCI data. Experimental studies are carried out using two benchmark BCI competition data sets. Our results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy classifier against its competing techniques. The proposed model paths the way for paralysed or disordered patients to use movement imagery to control different assistive devices in their daily activities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Brain informatics adopts a systematic methodology to study clinical diagnosis and pathology of mental disorders from macro, meso and micro points of view. Systematic studies produce multi-level and multi-aspect health big data of mental disorders. Effectively integrating multi-level mental health big data and providing multi-level and content-oriented data services for different types of users by an open and extendable mode becomes new requirements on the acquisition and computing of mental health big data. The existing Data-Brain-based brain data center cannot meet these new requirements. This paper proposes a brain and health big data center and develops a content-oriented cloud service architecture, namely, wisdom as a service, for realizing the brain and health big data center. The illustrative example demonstrates significance and usefulness of the proposed approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Supervisory control environments, such as the NASA control room can induce high workload levels in situations where a single error is capable of costing millions of dollars. An intelligent system can improve human supervisor performance by monitoring the human&amp;#x2019;s workload levels and intelligently adapting the system capabilities, such as adapting the interaction medium or reallocating roles and responsibilities between the human and the system. Systems capable of responding promptly and accurately to the human&amp;#x2019;s changes in workload require a workload assessment algorithm that can detect changes to all components of workload in real time. A review of 24 workload assessment algorithms across six task domains is provided. Each algorithm is reviewed based on four criteria: sensitivity, diagnosticity, suitability, and generalizability. The majority of the reviewed algorithms were developed for a specific task domain and are unable to generalize different tasks. Further, the majority of the algorithms do not account for individual differences, only assess one or two workload components, and do not classify underload.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Text mining have gained great momentum in recent years, with user-generated content becoming widely available. One key use is comment mining, with much attention being given to sentiment analysis and opinion mining. An essential step in the process of comment mining is text pre-processing; a step in which each linguistic term is assigned with a weight that commonly increases with its appearance in the studied text, yet is offset by the frequency of the term in the domain of interest. A common practice is to use the well-known tf-idf formula to compute these weights.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The accuracy of user location information is inversely proportional to the user&amp;#x0027;s privacy preserving degree k, and is proportional to quality of query service. In order to balance the conflict between privacy preserving security and query quality caused by the accuracy of location information, a clustering algorithm aiming at eliminating outliers based on k-anonymity location privacy preserving model is proposed, which is used to realize the establishment of anonymous group in the anonymous model. The distribution of user in anonymous group is optimized. The idea of replacing the user location query by the center of the anonymous group is proposed. The number of repeated queries is reduced and the quality of query service is improved on the premise of ensuring security through the experimental analysis and comparison with other schemes.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Despite recent successes of deep learning in many fields of natural language processing, previous studies of emotion recognition on Twitter mainly focused on the use of lexicons and simple classifiers on bag-of-words models. The central question of our study is whether we can improve their performance using deep learning. To this end, we exploit hashtags to create three large emotion-labeled data sets corresponding to different classifications of emotions. We then compare the performance of several word- and character-based recurrent and convolutional neural networks with the performance on bag-of-words and latent semantic indexing models. We also investigate the transferability of the final hidden state representations between different classifications of emotions, and whether it is possible to build a unison model for predicting all of them using a shared representation. We show that recurrent neural networks, especially character-based ones, can improve over bag-of-words and latent semantic indexing models. Although the transfer capabilities of these models are poor, the newly proposed training heuristic produces a unison model with performance comparable to that of the three single models.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cloud Computing leverages Hadoop framework for processing BigData in parallel. Hadoop has certain limitations that could be exploited to execute the job efficiently. These limitations are mostly because of data locality in the cluster, jobs and tasks scheduling, and resource allocations in Hadoop. Efficient resource allocation remains a challenge in Cloud Computing MapReduce platforms. We propose H2Hadoop, which is an enhanced Hadoop architecture that reduces the computation cost associated with BigData analysis. The proposed architecture also addresses the issue of resource allocation in native Hadoop. H2Hadoop provides a better solution for &amp;#x201C;text data&amp;#x201D;, such as finding DNA sequence and the motif of a DNA sequence. Also, H2Hadoop provides an efficient Data Mining approach for Cloud Computing environments. H2Hadoop architecture leverages on NameNode&amp;#x2019;s ability to assign jobs to the TaskTrakers (DataNodes) within the cluster. By adding control features to the NameNode, H2Hadoop can intelligently direct and assign tasks to the DataNodes that contain the required data without sending the job to the whole cluster. Comparing with native Hadoop, H2Hadoop reduces CPU time, number of read operations, and another Hadoop factors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposed a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, PSO-ABC (Particle Swarm Optimization-Artificial Bee Colony), based on the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and ABC (Artificial Bee Colony) algorithms. The ABC algorithm can offset defects in the PSO algorithm that easily fall into a local optimization; combining the algorithms can improve the optimization ability of the PSO algorithm to a certain extent. Therefore, this paper applied the PSO-ABC hybrid algorithm and the finite element method to systematically optimize the mechanical performance of the disc rotor of a bike and verified the numerical computation model via the WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) technology. The experimental test was completed with wireless sensor network technologies. To verify the optimized effects of the proposed PSO-ABC hybrid algorithm after parameter selection, the algorithm was compared with the traditional PSO and ABC models. The PSO, ABC and PSO-ABC models adopted the same population to conduct a multi-objective optimization for vibration accelerations of the disc rotor. Comparing the results from these models proved that the proposed PSO-ABC method is superior for the optimization of vibration characteristics of disc rotors.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the big data era, the generation of data presents some new characteristics, including wide distribution, high velocity, high dimensionality and privacy concern. To address these challenges for big data analytics, we develop a privacy-preserving distributed online learning framework on the data collected from distributed data sources. Specifically, each node (i.e., data source) has the capacity of learning a model from its local dataset, and exchanges intermediate parameters with a random part of their own neighboring (logically connected) nodes. Hence, the topology of the communications in our distributed computing framework is unfixed in practice. As online learning always performs on the sensitive data, we introduce the notion of differential privacy (DP) into our distributed online learning algorithm (DOLA) to protect the data privacy during the learning, which prevents an adversary from inferring any significant sensitive information. Our model is of general value for big data analytics in the distributed setting, because it can provide rigorous and scalable privacy proof and have much less computational complexity when compared to classic schemes, e.g., secure multiparty computation (SMC). To tackle high-dimensional incoming data entries, we study a sparse version of the DOLA. Numerical experiment results validate the feasibility of our private DOLAs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Industrial site selection involves a large number of criteria and location alternatives; consequently, the selection process leads to extended decision-making periods and requires complex knowledge management, classification, and analysis skills. The selection criteria are generally described by a number of different features expressed as both quantitative and qualitative measures that can involve some uncertainty. Moreover, the goals considered in the selection process are frequently nonlinearly related to the criteria; thus, they give rise to an optimization problem that is nonlinear with respect to each goal. Consequently, decision making requires appropriate support to enable efficient data optimization and classification under uncertainty before the final selection of an industrial site is made. This paper presents a novel intelligent decision support system for classifying industrial sites according to quality criteria estimated by exploiting a geographic information system, expert knowledge, and machine learning techniques. The proposed system is based on a geographic information system for generating location alternatives and a hierarchical neuro-fuzzy approach for site classification. The neuro-fuzzy method is based on a knowledge base designed by experts in the field and uses a neural approach to tune the parameters of the membership functions. Experimental results on real-world problems show that the proposed system provides accurate results for industrial site classification at the local level (micro locations).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recently, local differential privacy (LDP), as a strong and practical notion, has been applied to deal with privacy issues in data collection. However, existing LDP-based strategies mainly focus on utility optimization at a single privacy level while ignoring various privacy preferences of data providers and multilevel privacy demands for statistics. In this paper, we for the first time propose a framework to optimize the utility of histogram estimation with these two privacy requirements. To clarify the goal of privacy protection, we personalize the traditional definition of LDP. We design two independent approaches to minimize the utility loss: Advanced Combination, which composes multilevel results for utility optimisation, and Data Recycle with Personalized Privacy, which enlarges sample size for an estimation. We demonstrate their effectiveness on privacy and utility, respectively. Moreover, we embed these approaches within a Recycle and Combination Framework and prove that the framework stably achieves the optimal utility by quantifying its error bounds. On real-world datasets, our approaches are experimentally validated and remarkably outperform baseline methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Drawings of non-planar graphs always result in edge crossings. When there are many edges crossing at small angles, it is often difficult to follow these edges, because of the multiple visual paths resulted from the crossings that slow down eye movements. In this paper we propose an algorithm that disambiguates the edges with automatic selection of distinctive colors. Our proposed algorithm computes a near optimal color assignment of a dual collision graph, using a novel branch-and-bound procedure applied to a space decomposition of the color gamut. We give examples demonstrating this approach in real world graphs and maps, as well as a user study to establish its effectiveness and limitations.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Motivated by the great potential of implicit and seamless user authentication, we attempt to build an implicit authentication (IA) system with adaptive sampling that automatically selects dynamic sets of activities for user behavior extraction. Various activities, such as user location, application usage, user motion, and battery usage have been popular choices to generate behaviors, the soft biometrics, for implicit authentication. Unlike password-based or hard biometric-based authentication, implicit authentication does not require explicit user action or expensive hardware. However, user behaviors can change unpredictably which renders it more challenging to develop systems that depend on them. In addition to dynamic behavior extraction, the proposed implicit authentication system differs from the existing systems in terms of energy efficiency for battery-powered mobile devices. Since implicit authentication systems including the proposed one rely on machine learning, the expensive training process needs be outsourced to the remote server. However, mobile devices may not always have reliable network connections to send real-time data to the server for training. We overcome this limitation by proposing a W-layer, an overlay that provides a practical and energy-efficient solution for implicit authentication on mobile devices. We implemented partially labeled Dirichlet allocation (PLDA) on the server side for more accurate feature extraction, and achieved 93.3% precision and 98.6% accuracy in our experiments. Furthermore, we tested the power consumption of the smartphones used for our experiments and found that our method consumed 14.5% of the devices&amp;#x2019; total battery usage.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Recognition of a human's continuous emotional states in real time plays an important role in machine emotional intelligence and human-machine interaction. Existing real-time emotion recognition systems use stimuli with low ecological validity (e.g., picture, sound) to elicit emotions and to recognise only valence and arousal. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we construct a standardised database of 16 emotional film clips that were selected from over one thousand film excerpts. Based on emotional categories that are induced by these film clips, we propose a real-time movie-induced emotion recognition system for identifying an individual&amp;#x2019;s emotional states through the analysis of brain waves. Thirty participants took part in this study and watched 16 standardised film clips that characterise real-life emotional experiences and target seven discrete emotions and neutrality. Our system uses a 2-s window and a 50% overlap between two consecutive windows to segment the EEG signals. Emotional states, including not only the valence and arousal dimensions but also similar discrete emotions in the valence-arousal coordinate space, are predicted in each window. Our real-time system achieves an overall accuracy of 92.26% in recognising high-arousal and valenced emotions from neutrality and 86.63% in recognising positive from negative emotions. Moreover, our system classifies three positive emotions (joy, amusement, tenderness) with an average of 86.43% accuracy and four negative emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness) with an average of 65.09% accuracy. These results demonstrated the advantage over the existing state-of-the-art real-time emotion recognition systems from EEG signals in terms of classification accuracy and the ability to recognise similar discrete emotions that are close in the valence-arousal coordinate space.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Women who have recovered from breast cancer always fear its recurrence. The fact that they have endured the painstaking treatment makes recurrence their greatest fear. However, with current advancements in technology, early recurrence prediction can help patients receive treatment earlier. The availability of extensive data and advanced methods make accurate and fast prediction possible. This research aims to compare the accuracy of a few existing data mining algorithms in predicting breast cancer recurrence. It embeds particle swarm optimization as feature selection into three renowned classifiers, namely, naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, and fast decision tree learner, with the objective of increasing the accuracy level of the prediction model.</dcterms:abstract>

The aim of this paper is to propose a strongly robust method to solve multi-experts multi-criteria decision making problems with linguistic evaluations. To enrich the computation and to improve the measures of probabilistic linguistic term set, we firstly define an expectation function of it. In addition, we advance three kinds of probabilistic linguistic distance measures reflecting on the difference of linguistic terms and probabilities at the same time to make up for the defects of the existing distance measures, and then propose the similarity and correlation measures. Integrating the subjective opinions with the correlation coefficients between criteria, we put forward a combined weight determining method. The robustness of the ranking method, MULTIMOORA, is enhanced by the improved Borda rule. Based on these research findings, a probabilistic linguistic MULTIMOORA method is proposed. Finally, the developed method is applied to an empirical example concerning the selection of shared karaoke television brands. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some comparative analyses.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Presented in the paper is a novel approach to synchronization of shore and ship power systems, providing a blackout-free supply from the shore. An application of the shore-to-ship synchronization strategy, proposed in the paper, instead of the commonly used ship-to-shore synchronization, enables a fuller exploitation of the high dynamic offered by power electronic converters. Converters are increasingly being used in shore-to-ship supply arrangements in order to ensure the required levels of voltages and frequencies, specified in shore-supply related standards. Simulation results, supported by preliminary tests in small-scale experimental arrangements, have confirmed that shore-to-ship applications might significantly improve the dynamics of the synchronization as well as the parameters of the load transferring process, especially under distorted ship voltage conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Fog computing is an emerging paradigm that extends computation, communication, and storage facilities towards the edge of a network. Compared to traditional cloud computing, fog computing can support delay-sensitive service requests from End-Users (EUs) with reduced energy consumption and low traffic congestion. Basically, fog networks are viewed as offloading to core computation and storage. Fog nodes in fog computing decide to either process the services using its available resource or send to the cloud server. Thus, fog computing helps to achieve efficient resource utilization and higher performance regarding the delay, bandwidth, and energy consumption. This survey starts by providing an overview and fundamental of fog computing architecture. Furthermore, service and resource allocation approaches are summarized to address several critical issues such as latency, and bandwidth, and energy consumption in fog computing. Afterward, compared to other surveys, this paper provides an extensive overview of state-of-the-art network applications and major research aspects to design these networks. In addition, this study highlights ongoing research effort, open challenges, and research trends in fog computing.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the latest years, a number of citizen movements and protests have spread across the world. One of the characteristics of such events is that demonstrations have been aroused by the use of social networking channels such as Twitter, Facebook, and Whatsapp, among others. Different scholars are currently analyzing this phenomenon to better understand its impact on societies. Furthermore, the use of the Internet as a driver or tool for organizing different groups and demonstrations leaves traces of social changes that have been addressed by technology. Nevertheless, it is important to define ways of identifying different movements, as well as possible misuse by so-called Internet trolls or hijackers, whose objective is to start arguments and confuse or upset other users. In this work, the authors present the case of demonstrations in Ecuador from March 2015 to April 2016 and use data from Twitter users who engaged in those demonstrations. Ecuador has a long history of demonstrations against different governments, which makes this scenario very attractive for more in depth study. Moreover, the authors present a framework for identifying political interest groups as well as possible hashtag hijackers. Specifically, this work focuses on the problem of giving recommendations to groups in which a group of users with the same political view receives suggestions of users they should not follow because they have opposing political views but use hijacked hashtags. Experiments on real-world data collected from the previously mentioned demonstrations show the effectiveness of this approach in automatically identifying hijackers so that they can be effectively recommended to a group as people they should not follow.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents and experimentally demonstrates a novel high-capacity switching system with several types of optical switches, based on time division multiplexing (TDM), space division multiplexing (SDM) and coherently modulated packet spatial super-channels (pSSCs), suitable for converged inter/intra data center networks (DCNs). The fundamental subsystem of this network is the core-joint optical switch which enables efficient switching of all the spatial channels of the multi-core fibers (MCFs) used for data transmission. Three novel core-joint optical switches, for 7-core MCF and varying granularities to accommodate different network functions, are developed: an electro absorption (EA)-based, ns-fast joint switch, b) an acousto optical modulator (AOM)-based, &amp;#x03BC;s-fast joint switch and c) a free-space mirror-based, ms-fast joint switch. We use these three subsystems in a 2 x 2 switching node that makes use of 64 wavelength channels, 7-core MCFs and coherently modulated pSSCs to experimentally demonstrate a record switching capacity of 53.3 Tb/s/port and network protection capabilities in less than 10 ms in the event of a MCF failure.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a visualization framework that aids readers in understanding and analyzing the contents of medium-sized text collections that are typical for the opus of a single or few authors.We contribute several document-based visualization techniques to facilitate the exploration of the work of the German author Bazon Brock by depicting various aspects of its texts, such as the TextGenetics that shows the structure of the collection along with its chronology. The ConceptCircuit augments the TextGenetics with entities - persons and locations that were crucial to his work. All visualizations are sensitive to a wildcard-based phrase search that allows complex requests towards the author&amp;#x0027;s work. Further development, as well as expert reviews and discussions with the author Bazon Brock, focused on the assessment and comparison of visualizations based on automatic topic extraction against ones that are based on expert knowledge.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper presents a multimodal emotion recognition system, which is based on the analysis of audio and visual cues. From the audio channel, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Filter Bank Energies and prosodic features are extracted. For the visual part, two strategies are considered. First, facial landmarks&amp;#x2019; geometric relations, i.e. distances and angles, are computed. Second, we summarize each emotional video into a reduced set of key-frames, which are taught to visually discriminate between the emotions. In order to do so, a convolutional neural network is applied to key-frames summarizing videos. Finally, confidence outputs of all the classifiers from all the modalities are used to define a new feature space to be learned for final emotion label prediction, in a late fusion/stacking fashion. The experiments conducted on the SAVEE, eNTERFACE&amp;#x2019;05, and RML databases show significant performance improvements by our proposed system in comparison to current alternatives, defining the current state-of-the-art in all three databases.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Identity deception detection methods have been proposed for social media platforms with high effectiveness but their efficiency can vary. Previous literature has not examined the potential of these methods to work as real-time monitoring systems. Such implementations highlight further the challenges of applying computationally intensive methods in online environments that involve large datasets and high speeds of data. This paper attempts to classify detection methods based on the approaches and identifies factors that in real-time systems will impact the effectiveness and efficiency of these methods. Optimizations are proposed that can limit the computational overhead. Further challenges involving real-time identity deception detection are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Changes in motor pattern have been shown to be a useful advanced indicator of cognitive disorders, such as cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and stroke. It would be highly advantageous to tap into data containing people&amp;#x0027;s motor patterns from motion sensing devices to analyze subtle changes in cognitive abilities, thereby providing personalized interventions before the actual onset of such conditions. However, this goal is very challenging because: 1) the size of motor pattern data from motion sensing devices is small, and 2) the available data tend to be highly imbalanced (mostly from normal subjects). In order to effectively deal with these challenges to infer cognitive abilities from motor patterns with high accuracy, we propose the MOtor-Cognitive Analytics (MOCA) framework. The core of this framework is a novel feature selection method IRFFS-O and a novel classification approach b-WELM which, together, address the above-mentioned challenges. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that MOCA can effectively select the most significant features for specific disease detection, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring people&amp;#x0027;s cognitive capabilities. This work opens up opportunities for population-level pre-screening using motion sensing devices and can inform current discussions on reforming the healthcare infrastructure.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the increasing popularity of video delivery among mobile users, the problem of explosive traffic growth becomes more and more serious for mobile wireless networks. To deal with this problem, we propose to exploit opportunistic transmission and crowdsourcing to offload mobile video traffic. Based on this idea, a QoV oriented pricing incentive scheme, namely Vbargain, is proposed to stimulate mobile users to deliver video data collaboratively. More specifically, in our scheme, the network is regarded as a virtual market, and the video packets are treated as commodities, which are dynamically priced according to their expected marginal gains on the quality of reconstructed video; the process of video delivery is regarded as a sequence of packet transactions which are modeled as two-person cooperative games. Driven by the profit-hunting nature of mobile users, video data is delivered from the source to its destination. In order to gain deep insight into our scheme, we also analyze the overhead and influence of start-up capital on the performance of video delivered theoretically, and give the lower bound and upper bound of its amount. Our simulation results, based on both the synthetic and real-life traces of mobile users, verify the efficiency of our scheme and analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Research into cyberbullying detection has increased in recent years, due in part to the proliferation of cyberbullying across social media and its detrimental effect on young people. A growing body of work is emerging on automated approaches to cyberbullying detection. These approaches utilise machine learning and natural language processing techniques to identify the characteristics of a cyberbullying exchange and automatically detect cyberbullying by matching textual data to the identified traits. In this paper, we present a systematic review of published research (as identified via Scopus, ACM and IEEE Xplore bibliographic databases) on cyberbullying detection approaches. On the basis of our extensive literature review, we categorise existing approaches into 4 main classes, namely; supervised learning, lexicon based, rule based and mixed-initiative approaches. Supervised learning-based approaches typically use classifiers such as SVM and Na&amp;#x00EF;ve Bayes to develop predictive models for cyberbullying detection. Lexicon based systems utilise word lists and use the presence of words within the lists to detect cyberbullying. Rules-based approaches match text to predefined rules to identify bullying and mixed-initiatives approaches combine human-based reasoning with one or more of the aforementioned approaches. We found lack of quality representative labelled datasets and non-holistic consideration of cyberbullying by researchers when developing detection systems are two key challenges facing cyberbullying detection research. This paper essentially maps out the state-of-the-art in cyberbullying detection research and serves as a resource for researchers to determine where to best direct their future research efforts in this field.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Action recognition from videos is an important area of computer vision research due to its various applications, ranging from visual surveillance to human-computer interaction. To address action recognition problems, this paper presents a framework that jointly models multiple complex actions and motion units at different hierarchical levels. We achieve this by proposing a generative topic model, namely Multi-label Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (ML-HDP). The ML-HDP model formulates the co-occurrence relationship of actions and motion units, and enables highly accurate recognition. In particular, our topic model possesses the three-level representation in action understanding, where low-level local features are connected to high-level actions via mid-level atomic actions. This allows the recognition model to work discriminatively. In our ML-HDP, atomic actions are treated as latent topics and automatically discovered from data. In addition, we incorporate the notion of class labels into our model in a semi-supervised fashion to effectively learn and infer multi-labeled videos. Using discovered topics and inferred labels, which are jointly assigned to local features, we present the straightforward methods to perform three recognition tasks including: action classification, joint classification and segmentation of continuous actions, and spatiotemporal action localization. In experiments, we explore the use of three different features and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for these tasks on four public datasets: KTH, MSR-II, Hollywood2, and UCF101.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper studies distributed optimization problems where a network of agents seeks to minimize the sum of their private cost functions. We propose new algorithms based on the distributed subgradient method and the finite-time consensus protocol introduced by Sundaram and Hadjicostis (2007). In our first algorithm, the local optimization variables are updated cyclically through a subgradient step while the consensus variables follow a usual consensus protocol periodically interrupted by a predictive consensus estimate re-set operation. For convex cost functions with bounded subgradients, this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a certain range of the optimal value if using a constant step size or to the optimal value if a diminishing step size is in place. For differentiable cost functions whose sum is convex and has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, convergence to the optimal value can be ensured when using a constant step size, even if some of the individual cost functions are nonconvex. In addition, exponential convergence to the optimal solution is achieved when the global cost function is further assumed to be strongly convex. In these cases, the local opt</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>It is common practice for developers of user-facing software to transform a mock-up of a graphical user interface (GUI) into code. This process takes place both at an application&amp;#x0027;s inception and in an evolutionary context as GUI changes keep pace with evolving features. Unfortunately, this practice is challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an approach that automates this process by enabling accurate prototyping of GUIs via three tasks: detection, classification, and assembly. First, logical components of a GUI are detected from a mock-up artifact using either computer vision techniques or mock-up metadata. Then, software repository mining, automated dynamic analysis, and deep convolutional neural networks are utilized to accurately classify GUI-components into domain-specific types (e.g., toggle-button). Finally, a data-driven, K-nearest-neighbors algorithm generates a suitable hierarchical GUI structure from which a prototype application can be automatically assembled. We implemented this approach for Android in a system called ReDraw. Our evaluation illustrates that ReDraw achieves an average GUI-component classification accuracy of 91% and assembles prototype applications that closely mirror target mock-ups in terms of visual affinity while exhibiting reasonable code structure. Interviews with industrial practitioners illustrate ReDraw&amp;#x0027;s potential to improve real development workflows.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Characterizing the evolution of social networks is challenging, because social networks tend to be large. In addition, their evolution entails latent variables, such as unobserved meeting states. The objective of this paper was to develop a utility-based model with preference parameters for clarifying the reasons for the behavior underlying network evolution. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm combined with snowball sampling (SS) was proposed for parameter estimation. EM is suitable to cope with the data set with latent variables or missing data and SS would be helpful in decreasing the network size without loss of critical information. Simulation studies were further performed to assess the effects of network size, seed set size, meeting probabilities, sampling waves, and sampling methods on the summary statistics of estimates and to highlight the importance of the unobserved variables. Finally, an application was developed on the Facebook platform to demonstrate the model. In all, the proposed model is expected to be a novel tool for exploring and understanding the evolution of social networks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The detection of groups of individuals is attracting the attention of many researchers in diverse fields, from automated surveillance to human-computer interaction, with a growing number of approaches published every year. Unexpectedly, the evaluation metrics for this problem are not consolidated, with some measures inherited from different fields, other designed specifically for a particular approach, thus lacking in generalization and making the comparisons between different approaches difficult. Moreover, most of the existent metrics are scarcely expressive, addressing groups as atomic entities, ignoring that they may have different cardinalities, and that group detection approaches may fail in capturing the exact number of individuals that compose it. This paper fills this gap presenting the GROup DEtection (GRODE) metrics, which formally define precision and recall on the groups, including the group cardinality as a variable. This gives the possibility to investigate aspects never considered so far, such as the tendency of a method of over- or under-segmenting, or of better dealing with specific group cardinalities. The GRODE metrics have been evaluated first on controlled scenarios, where the differences with alternative metrics are evident, as well as on public datasets, providing a fresh-new panorama of the state-of-the-art.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have recently gained increasing popularity. Timeaware Point-of-Interest(POI) recommendation is one of the most important location-aware services, which can recommend locations to a target user at the specific time based on check-in history. However, current techniques ignore user&amp;#x2019;s mobility within a region, which plays a vital role in the POI chosen decision. Most of existing algorithms fail to capture the latent relations behind the temporal factors and geographical influence. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Time-aware POI Recommendation model based on User Mobility: TPR-UM, which improves the POI recommendation accuracy greatly. More specifically, by introducing the implicit region factor, we capture users&amp;#x2019; mobility through collective user actions and geographical properties of locations. We generate the check-in patterns based on different time intervals and different regions to exploit the latent relations between temporal factors and geographical influence. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Gowalla and Foursquare. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid method is effective and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of precision, recall and F&amp;#x03B2; measurement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>People often face risk-prone situations, that range from a mild event to a severe, life-threatening scenario. Risk situations stem from a number of different scenarios: a health condition, a hazard situation due to a natural disaster, a dangerous situation because one is being subject to a crime or physical violence, among others. The lack of a prompt response, calling for assistance, may severely worsen the consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel visualisation method to track and to identify, in real-time, when a person is under a risk-prone situation. Our visualisation model is capable of providing a decision maker a visual description of the physiological behaviour of an individual, or a group thereof; through it, the decision maker may infer whether further assistance is required, if a risky situation is in progress. Our visualisation is leveraged with a traffic light model of a one-class classifier. This combination allows us to train the decision maker into visualising correct and potential risky or abnormal behaviour.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We present an affective model for an autonomous decision agent implementable within non-expensive robotic platforms. The agent makes decisions influenced by affective factors when interacting with humans and other agents under the Adversarial Risk Analysis framework. The model is based on a multi-objective additive utility function, with weights partly regulated by the agent&amp;#x0027;s emotional states and mood. Our motivation for this work is not to provide a more accurate descriptive model, but rather to use affection as a basic element within a decision-making process that could lead to improved performance of a robotic agent, possibly making it more attractive. This would facilitate its adoption in application areas such as companion pets to provide emotional support to the elderly or kids with autism, or as educational support within an edutainment framework.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a new sensing framework that empowers normal mobile devices to participate in sensing tasks. The key challenge that degrades the performance of MCS is selfish mobile users who conserve the resources (e.g., CPU, battery and bandwidth) of their devices. Thus, we introduce energy harvesting (EH) as rewards into MCS and thus provide more possibilities to improve the quality of service (QoS) of the system. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach for achieving sustainable and higher-quality sensing task execution in MCS. The proposed solution is implemented as a two-stage game. The first stage of the game is the system reward game, in which the system is the leader, who allocates the task and reward, and the mobile devices are the followers who execute the tasks. The second stage of the game is called the participant decision-making game, in which we consider both the network channel condition and participant&amp;#x2019;s abilities. We analyse the features of the second stage of the game and show that the game admits a Nash Equilibrium (NE). Based on the NE of the second stage of the game, the system can admit a Stackelberg Equilibrium, at which the utility is maximized. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve better QoS and prolong the system lifetime while also providing a proper incentive mechanism for MCS.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a new paradigm where IoT merges with Social Networks, allowing people and devices to interact, and facilitating information sharing. However, security and privacy issues are a great challenge for IoT but they are also enabling factors to create a &amp;#x201C;trust ecosystem&amp;#x201D;. In fact, the intrinsic vulnerabilities of IoT devices, with limited resources and heterogeneous technologies, together with the lack of specifically designed IoT standards, represent a fertile ground for the expansion of specific cyber threats. In this paper, we try to bring order on the IoT security panorama providing a taxonomic analysis from the perspective of the three main key layers of the IoT system model: Perception, Transportation and Application levels. As a result of the analysis, we will highlight the most critical issues with the aim of guiding future research directions. Index terms: Internet of Things, IoT System Model, Cyber Threats, Trust, IoT Security, IoT Protocols.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel design paradigm, intended as a network of billions to trillions of tiny sensors communicating with each other to offer innovative solutions to real time problems. These sensors form a network named as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to monitor physical environment and disseminate collected data back to the base station through multiple hops. WSN has the capability to collect and report data for a specific application. The location information plays an important role for various wireless sensor network applications. A majority of the applications are related to location based services (LBS). The development of sensor technology, processing techniques and communication systems give rise to a development of the smart sensor for the adaptive and innovative application. So a single localization technique is not adequate for all application. In this paper, a recent extensive analysis of localization techniques and hierarchical taxonomy and their applications in the different context is presented. This taxonomy of the localization technique is classified based on presence of offline training in localization namely self determining and training dependent approaches. Finally, various open research issue related to localization schemes for IoT are compared and proposed various directions for future research.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the Green Cloudlet Network (GCN) architecture, each User Equipment (UE) is associated with an Avatar (which is considered as a private virtual machine for executing its UE&amp;#x0027;s offloaded tasks) in a cloudlet, which is located at the network edge. In order to reduce the operational expenditure for maintaining the distributed cloudlets, each cloudlet is powered by green energy and uses on-grid power as a backup. Owing to the spatial dynamics of energy demands and green energy generations, the energy gap among different cloudlets in the network is unbalanced, i.e., some cloudlets&amp;#x0027; energy demands can be fully provisioned by their green energy generations but others need to utilize on-grid power to meet their energy demands. The unbalanced energy gap increases the on-grid power consumption of the cloudlets. In this paper, we propose the Green-energy aware Avatar Placement (GAP) strategy to minimize the total on-grid power consumption of the cloudlets by migrating Avatars among the cloudlets according to the cloudlets&amp;#x0027; residual green energy, while guaranteeing the service level agreement (which is defined as the End-to-End (E2E) delay requirement between a UE and its Avatar). Simulation results show that GAP can save 57.1% and 57.6% of on-grid power consumption as compared to the two other Avatar placement strategies, respectively.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>While many studies on typical recommender systems focus on making recommendations to individual users, many social activities involve groups of users. Issues related to group recommendations are increasingly becoming hot research topics. Among differences between individual and group recommender systems, the most significant one is social factors of group users. Social factors, including personality, expertise factor, interpersonal relationships, and preference similarities, widen the gap between group and individual recommendations. Here, a new approach focusing on the impact of social factors on group recommender systems is proposed. A computational model integrating the influences of personality, expertise factor, interpersonal relationships, and preference similarities is described in detail. Comparative experiments are conducted on two datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can provide more accurate and satisfactory group recommendations, especially when social influences are significant.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In this paper we present an innovative system based on social media and high quality multimedia content delivery designed to enhance the educational experiences of students in cultural centers and museums. The system brings together students that are viewing an educational movie with a panel of experts that may be geographically dispersed, and engages them in an exciting social media experience via which they can interact with each other as well as with the remote experts. We employ appropriate methodologies for monitoring and analysing social network activity in order to extract valuable information from the social network activity and use it to seamlessly annotate in real-time the presented educational movie using anthropocentric semantic extraction based on MPEG-7. In this way, the multimedia content of the presented movie can be easily reviewed by multiple geographically dispersed individuals, and impoved afterwards according to the received feedback, thus maximising the benefit for students, teachers and content producers alike.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Cross-scene regression tasks such as congestion level detection and crowd counting are useful but challenging. There are two main problems which limit the performance of existing algorithms. The first one is that no appropriate congestion related feature can reflect the real density in scenes. Though deep learning has been proved to be capable of extracting high level semantic representations, it is hard to converge on regression tasks since the label is too weak to guide the learning of parameters in practice. Thus, many approaches utilize additional information such as density map to guide the learning which increases the effort of labeling. Another one is that most existing methods are composed of several steps, for example feature extraction and regression. Since the steps in pipeline are separated, these methods face the problem of complex optimization. To remedy it, a deep metric learning based regression method is proposed to extract density related features, and learn better distance measurement simultaneously. The proposed network trained endto- end for better optimization can be used for crowdedness regression tasks including congestion level detection and crowd counting. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In a pricing-based spectrum trading market, an interesting issue is to study how secondary users make their selections in a rational manner when there are available spectrum of different qualities in the market. In this case, primary systems inherently require a precise pricing strategy to maximize their profits especially when the secondary users' selection preferences are not uniform nor predictable during the dynamic access. In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum pricing mechanism for primary systems by taking into account the selection preferences of heterogeneous secondary users and quality diversity of leased spectrum caused by different interference levels and channel fading characteristics. Our work mainly focuses on exploring the optimal pricing solution in the case that the selection preference of secondary buyers is stochastic. In the proposed system model, the spectrum to be leased is divided into a series of uniform subchannels of various qualities for spectrum trading. We analyze the impact of secondary users' preference on spectrum trading, and propose an iterative algorithm for spectrum pricing by introducing Hotelling model to describe the relationship between the spectrum diversity and the primary system's utility. Proofs of the integrability of the utility function and existence of Nash equilibrium used in the proposed algorithm are provided. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pricing method in improving the primary system's profits.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Research into self-regulated learning has traditionally relied upon self-reported data. While there is a rich body of literature that has extracted invaluable information from such sources, it suffers from a number of shortcomings. For instance, it has been shown that surveys often provide insight into students&amp;#x0027; perceptions about learning rather than how students actually employ study tactics and learning strategies. Accordingly, recent research has sought to assess students&amp;#x0027; learning strategies and, by extension, their self-regulated learning via trace data collected from digital learning environments. A number of studies have amply demonstrated the ability of educational data mining and learning analytics methods to identify patterns indicative of learning strategies within trace log data. However, many of these methods are limited in their ability to describe and interpret differences between extracted latent representations at varying levels of granularity (for instance, in terms of the underlying data of student actions and behaviour). To address this limitation, the present study proposes a new methodology whereby interpretable representations of student&amp;#x0027;s self-regulating behaviour are derived at two theoretically inspired levels: that of learning strategies, and the study tactics that compose them.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Key-based workload partitioning is now commonly used in parallel stream processing, enabling effective key-value tuple distribution over worker threads in a logical operator. While randomized hashing on the keys is capable of balancing the workload for key-based partitioning when the keys generally follow a static distribution, it is likely to generate poor balancing performance when workload variance occurs on the incoming data stream. This paper presents a new key-based workload partitioning framework, with practical algorithms to support dynamic workload assignment for stateful operators. The framework combines hash-based and explicit key-based routing strategies for workload distribution, which specifies the destination worker threads for a handful of keys and assigns the other keys with the hashing function. We formulate the rebalance operation as an optimization problem, with multiple objectives on minimizing state migration costs, controlling the size of the routing table and breaking workload imbalance among the worker threads. Despite of the NP-hardness nature behind the optimization formulation, we carefully investigate and justify the heuristics behind key (re)routing and state migration, to facilitate fast response to workload variance with ignorable cost to the normal processing in the distributed system. Empirical studies on synthetic data and real-world stream applications validate the usefulness of our proposals and prove the huge advantage of our approaches over state-of-the-art solutions in the literature.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Microblog platforms have been extremely popular in the big data era due to its real-time diffusion of information. It&amp;#x2019;s important to know what anomalous events are trending on the social network and be able to monitor their evolution and find related anomalies. In this paper we demonstrate RING, a real-time emerging anomaly monitoring system over microblog text streams. RING integrates our efforts on both emerging anomaly monitoring research and system research. From the anomaly monitoring perspective, RING proposes a graph analytic approach such that (1) RING is able to detect emerging anomalies at an earlier stage compared to the existing methods, (2) RING is among the first to discover emerging anomalies correlations in a streaming fashion, (3) RING is able to monitor anomaly evolutions in real-time at different time scales from minutes to months. From the system research perspective, RING (1) optimizes time-ranged keyword query performance of a full-text search engine to improve the efficiency of monitoring anomaly evolution, (2) improves the dynamic graph processing performance of Spark and implements our graph stream model on it, As a result, RING is able to process big data to the entire Weibo or Twitter text stream with linear horizontal scalability. The system clearly presents its advantages over existing systems and methods from both the event monitoring perspective and the system perspective for the emerging event monitoring task.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper is concerned with mass evidence accumulation and risk assessment in a particular component of transportation systems and e-borders. We outline the challenges faced by contemporary border control technology and conduct a series of demonstrative experiments that cover critical scenarios, tasks, and states of both evidence accumulation and the traveler risk scoring engine. Using technology gap navigator methodology, this paper suggests an approach to traveler risk estimation based on a unified inference platform, such as a causal graphical model with various incorporated metrics of uncertainty.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Graphs are commonly used to represent objects, such as images and text, for pattern classification. In a dynamic world, an object may continuously evolve over time, and so does the graph extracted from the underlying object. These changes in graph structure with respect to the temporal order present a new representation of the graph, in which an object corresponds to a set of time-variant graphs. In this paper, we formulate a novel time-variant graph classification task and propose a new graph feature, called a graph-shapelet pattern, for learning and classifying time-variant graphs. Graph-shapelet patterns are compact and discriminative graph transformation subsequences. A graph-shapelet pattern can be regarded as a graphical extension of a shapelet--a class of discriminative features designed for vector-based temporal data classification. To discover graph-shapelet patterns, we propose to convert a time-variant graph sequence into time-series data and use the discovered shapelets to find graph transformation subsequences as graph-shapelet patterns. By converting each graph-shapelet pattern into a unique tokenized graph transformation sequence, we can measure the similarity between two graph-shapelet patterns and therefore classify time-variant graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Automatic depression assessment based on visual cues is a rapidly growing research domain. The present exhaustive review of existing approaches as reported in over sixty publications during the last ten years focuses on image processing and machine learning algorithms. Visual manifestations of depression, various procedures used for data collection, and existing datasets are summarized. The review outlines methods and algorithms for visual feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, decision methods for classification and regression approaches, as well as different fusion strategies. A quantitative meta-analysis of reported results, relying on performance metrics robust to chance, is included, identifying general trends and key unresolved issues to be considered in future studies of automatic depression assessment utilizing visual cues alone or in combination with vocal or verbal cues.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38,645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers. The results were promising and demonstrated the possibility of subsidizing the creation of inferences rules about possible patient health problems or preventing future problems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the increasing popularity and great economic benefit from vulnerability exploitation, it is important to study mobile vulnerability in the mobile ecosystem. Beyond the traditional technical solutions such as developing technologies to identify potential vulnerabilities, discover the widely available exploitations and protect consumers from attacks, constructing the vulnerability market, a marketplace for vulnerability discovery, disclosure and exploitation, has been considered as an effective approach. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of the vulnerability market for further optimizations is attracting attentions from both academia and industry. Since mobile ecosystem is playing an increasingly important role for the daily life, this paper aims to understand the evolution of the mobile vulnerability market in a data-driven approach, aiming to identify the important issues for further research. Specially, a fivelayer heterogeneous network, consisting of the software vendors, products, public disclosed vulnerabilities, hunters, organizations and their relations, is established to formally represent the evolution of the mobile vulnerability market. Based on the data collected from a variety of agencies, including NVD, OSVDB, BID and vendor advisories, a comprehensive empirical analysis is reported, focusing on the growth of the mobile vulnerability market as well as the interactions between mobile and other PCs platforms. Finally, suggestions drawn from the observations, , including security evaluation for code reused, data leaking protection and permission overuse identification, hunter&amp;#x2019;s strategy and behavior understanding, information sharing and external workforce hiring, as well as cross-platform vulnerability digging are discussed for further security enhancement.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Video captioning has been attracting broad research attention in the multimedia community. However, most existing approaches heavily rely on static visual information or partially capture the local temporal knowledge (e.g., within 16 frames), thus hardly describing motions accurately from a global view. In this paper, we propose a novel video captioning framework, which integrates bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) and a soft attention mechanism to generate better global representations for videos as well as enhance the recognition of lasting motions in videos. To generate video captions, we exploit another long-short term memory as a decoder to fully explore global contextual information. The benefits of our proposed method are two fold: 1) the BiLSTM structure comprehensively preserves global temporal and visual information and 2) the soft attention mechanism enables a language decoder to recognize and focus on principle targets from the complex content. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed video captioning framework on two widely used benchmarks, that is, microsoft video description corpus and MSR-video to text, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>This paper proposes a new method for reliable estimation of the actual query camera location by optimally utilizing structure from motion (SFM) for 3D camera position reconstruction, and introducing a new approach for effecting a linear transformation between two different 3D Cartesian coordinate systems. Since the success of SFM hinges on effectively selecting among the multiple retrieved images, we propose an optimization framework to do this using the criterion of the highest intra-class similarity among images returned from retrieval pipeline to increase SFM convergence rate. The selected images along with the query are then used to reconstruct a 3D scene and find the relative camera positions by employing SFM. In the last processing step an effective camera coordinate transformation algorithm is introduced to estimate the query's geo-tag, followed by a transformation of the query's estimated position to absolute world coordinates. The influence of the number of images involved in SFM on the ultimate position error is investigated by examining the use of three and four dataset images with different solution for calculating the query world coordinates. We have evaluated our proposed method on query images with known accurate ground-truth. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that our method outperforms other reported methods in terms of average error.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>While watching movies, audience members exhibit both subtle and coarse gestures (e.g., smiles, head-pose change, fidgeting, stretching) which convey sentiment (i.e engaged or disengaged) during feature length movies. Noticing these behaviors using computer vision systems is a very challenging problem &amp;#x2013; especially in a movie theatre environment. The environment is dark and contains views of people at different scales and viewpoints. Feature length movies typically run 80 &amp;#x2013; 120 minutes, and tracking people uninterrupted for this duration is still an unsolved problem. Facial expressions of audience members are subtle, short, and sparse; making it difficult to detect and recognize activities. Finally, annotating audience sentiment at the frame-level is prohibitively time consuming. To circumvent these issues, we use an infrared illuminated test-bed to obtain a visually uniform input of audiences watching feature length movies. We present a method which can automatically detect the change in behavior (key-gestures) using &amp;#x201C;key-frames&amp;#x201D;, which can convey audience sentiment. As the number of key-frames are many orders of magnitudes lower than the number of frames, the annotation problem is reduced to assigning a sentiment label for each key-frame. Using these discovered key-gestures, we create a movie rating classifier from crowd-sourced ratings and demonstrate its predictive capability. Our dataset consists of over 50 hours of audience behavior collected across 237 subjects.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Most existing work of domain adaptation aims to learn a classifier on a source domain and then predict the labels for target data, which indicates that only the knowledge derived from the hyperplane is transferred to the target domain and the structure information is ignored. To that end, we develop a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, which ensures the whole structure of source domains will be preserved and transferred to serve the task on the target domain. For that purpose, both source and target data are put together for clustering and the well-preserved structure information from the source domains will facilitate and guide the adaptation process in the target domain. To our knowledge, this is the first time when the domain adaptation problem is re-formulated as a semi-supervised clustering problem with target labels as missing values. Then we derive the algorithm of unsupervised domain adaptation and give its corresponding solution. Furthermore, by introducing an augmented matrix, a non-trivial solution is designed to exactly map it into a K-means-like optimization with modified distance function and update rule for centroids in an efficient way. Extensive experiments on two widely-used databases show the substantial improvements of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) provides a unique platform for vehicles to intelligently exchange critical information, such as collision avoidance messages. It is, therefore, paramount that this information remains reliable and authentic, i.e., originated from a legitimate and trusted vehicle. Trust establishment among vehicles can ensure security of VANET by identifying dishonest vehicles and revoking messages with malicious content. For this purpose, several trust models (TMs) have been proposed but, currently, there is no effective way to compare how they would behave in practice under adversary conditions. To this end, we propose a novel Trust Evaluation And Management (TEAM) framework, which serves as a unique paradigm for the design, management and evaluation of TMs in various contexts and in presence of malicious vehicles. Our framework incorporates an asset-based threat model and ISO-based risk assessment for the identification of attacks against critical risks. TEAM has been built using VEINS, an open source simulation environment which incorporates SUMO traffic simulator and OMNET++ discrete event simulator. The framework created has been tested with the implementation of three types of TM (dataoriented, entity-oriented and hybrid) under four different contexts of VANET based on the mobility of both honest and malicious vehicles. Results indicate that TEAM is effective to simulate a wide range of TMs, where the efficiency is evaluated against different Quality of Service (QoS) and security-related criteria. Such framework may be instrumental for planning smart cities and for car manufacturers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Insider attacks are among the most dangerous and costly attacks to organizations. These attacks are carried out by individuals who are legitimately authorized to access the system. Preventing insider attacks is a daunting task. The recent proliferation of social media and mobile devices offer new opportunities to collect geo-social information that can help in detecting and deterring insider attacks. In particular, such geo-social information allows us to better understand the context and behavior of users. In this paper, we propose a Geo-Social Insider Threat Resilient Access Control Framework (G-SIR) to deter insider threats by including current and historic geo-social information as part of the access control decision process. We include policy constraints to manage the risks of colluding communities, proximity threats, and suspicious users while leveraging the presence of users around the requester to make an access decision. By examining users&amp;#x2019; geo-social behavior, we can detect those users whose access behavior deviates from the expected patterns; such suspicious behaviors can point to potential insider attackers who may deliberately or inadvertently carry out malicious activities. We use such information to establish how trustworthy a user is before granting access. We evaluate the G-SIR framework through extensive simulations and our results show that the proposed approach is efficient, scalable and effective.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With explosive growth of data volume and ever-increasing diversity of data modalities, cross-modal similarity search, which conducts nearest neighbor search across different modalities, has been attracting increasing interest. This paper presents a deep compact code learning solution for efficient cross-modal similarity search. Many recent studies have proven that quantization-based approaches perform generally better than hashing-based approaches on single-modal similarity search. In this paper, we propose a deep quantization approach, which is among the early attempts of leveraging deep neural networks into quantization-based cross-modal similarity search. Our approach, dubbed shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ), explicitly formulates a shared subspace across different modalities and two private subspaces for individual modalities, and representations in the shared subspace and the private subspaces are learned simultaneously by embedding them to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the mean embedding of different modality distributions can be explicitly compared. In addition, in the shared subspace, a quantizer is learned to produce the semantics preserving compact codes with the help of label alignment. Thanks to this novel network architecture in cooperation with supervised quantization training, SPDQ can preserve intramodal and intermodal similarities as much as possible and greatly reduce quantization error. Experiments on two popular benchmarks corroborate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Here we present a robust physiological model for the recognition of human emotions, called Deep Physiological Affect Network. This model is based on a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network and a new temporal margin-based loss function. Formulating the emotion recognition problem as a spectral-temporal sequence classification problem of bipolar EEG signals underlying brain lateralization and photoplethysmogram signals, the proposed model improves the performance of emotion recognition. Specifically, the new loss function allows the model to be more confident as it observes more of specific feelings while training ConvLSTM models. The function is designed to result in penalties for the violation of such confidence. Our experiments on a public dataset show that our deep physiological learning technology significantly increases the recognition rate of state-of-the-art techniques by 15.96% increase in accuracy. An extensive analysis of the relationship between participants&amp;#x0027; emotion ratings and physiological changes in brain lateralization function during the experiment is also presented.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>A novel audio feature projection using Kernel Discriminative Locality Preserving Canonical Correlation Analysis (KDLPCCA)-based correlation with electroencephalogram (EEG) features for favorite music classification is presented in this paper. The projected audio features reflect individual music preference adaptively since they are calculated by considering correlations with the user&amp;#x0027;s EEG signals during listening to musical pieces that the user likes/dislikes via a novel CCA proposed in this paper. The novel CCA, called KDLPCCA, can consider not only a non-linear correlation but also local properties and discriminative information of each class sample, namely, music likes/dislikes. Specifically, local properties reflect intrinsic data structures of the original audio features, and discriminative information enhances the power of the final classification. Hence, the projected audio features have an optimal correlation with individual music preference reflected in the user&amp;#x0027;s EEG signals, adaptively. If the KDLPCCA-based projection that can transform original audio features into novel audio features is calculated once, our method can extract projected audio features from a new musical piece without newly observing individual EEG signals. Our method therefore has a high level of practicability. Consequently, effective classification of user&amp;#x0027;s favorite musical pieces via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the new projected audio features becomes feasible. Experimental results show that our method for favorite music classification using projected audio features via the novel CCA outperforms methods using original audio features, EEG features and even audio features projected by other state-of-the-art CCAs.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Developing scalable, semi-automatic approaches to derive insights from a domain-specific Web corpus is a longstanding research problem in the knowledge discovery community. The problem is particularly challenging in illicit fields, such as human trafficking, where traditional assumptions concerning information representation are frequently violated. In this article, we describe an end-to-end investigative knowledge discovery system for illicit Web domains. We built and evaluated a prototype, involving separate components for information extraction, semantic modeling and query execution, on a real-world human trafficking Web corpus containing 1.3 million pages, with promising results. The prototype includes a GUI currently used by US law enforcement agencies to combat illicit activity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Massive data collected by automated fare collection (AFC) systems provide opportunities for studying both personal traveling behaviors and collective mobility patterns in urban areas. Existing studies on AFC data have primarily focused on identifying passengers&amp;#x0027; movement patterns. However, we creatively leveraged such data for identifying pickpocket suspects. Stopping pickpockets in the public transit system has been crucial for improving passenger satisfaction and public safety. Nonetheless, in practice, it is challenging to discern thieves from regular passengers . In this paper, we developed a suspect detection and surveillance system, which can identify pickpocket suspects based on their daily transit records. Specifically, we first extracted a number of useful features from each passenger&amp;#x0027;s daily activities in the transit system. Then, we took a two-step approach that exploits the strengths of unsupervised outlier detection and supervised classification models to identify thieves, who typically exhibit abnormal traveling behaviors. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. We also developed a prototype system for potential uses by security personnel.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Pose estimation is vital for space robot to capture satellite. Dual poses including center position and normal direction can be obtained from a single perspective view of a radiusknown circle such as docking ring of the satellite. To solve the duality and recover the roll angle, this paper presents here a new method PCL (Perspective Circle and Line), which is based on the perspective view of a single circle and line. First of all, the dual center positions and normal directions are recovered with the circle and the image. Then the line is utilized to recover the roll angle of the circle analytically. By re-projecting a random point on the line to the image and verifying whether the projection lies on the image line, the false pose of the object is identified. Simulation and physical experiments show that the position and orientation of the circle can be recovered. But in practice they are affected by the accuracy of camera calibration and feature extraction. As a whole, PCL is robust to noise in pose estimation, especially in recovering the orientation</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Image aesthetic quality assessment has becoming an indispensable technique that facilitates a variety of image applications, e.g., photo retargeting and non-realistic rendering. Conventional approaches suffer from the following limitations: 1) the inefficiency of semantically describing images due to the inherent tag noise and incompletion, 2) the difficulty of accurately reflecting how humans actively perceive various regions inside each image, and 3) the challenge of incorporating the aesthetic experiences of multiple users. To solve these problems, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep active learning (SDAL) algorithm, which discovers how humans perceive semantically important regions from a large quantity of images partially assigned with contaminated tags. More specifically, as humans usually attend to the foreground objects before understanding them, we extract a succinct set of BING (binarized normed gradients) &amp;#x005B;60&amp;#x005D;-based object patches from each image. To simulate human visual perception, we propose SDAL which hierarchically learns human gaze shifting path (GSP) by sequentially linking semantically important object patches from each scenery. Noticeably, SDLA unifies the semantically important regions discovery and deep GSP feature learning into a principled framework, wherein only a small proportion of tagged images are adopted. Moreover, based on the sparsity penalty, SDLA can optimally abandon the noisy or redundant low-level image features. Finally, by leveraging the deeply-learned GSP features, a probabilistic model is developed for image aesthetics assessment, where the experience of multiple professional photographers can be encoded. Besides, auxiliary quality-related features can be conveniently integrated into our probabilistic model. Comprehensive experiments on a series of benchmark image sets have demonstrated the superiority of our method. As a byproduct, eye tracking experiments have shown that GSPs gener- ted by our SDAL are about 93&amp;#x0025; consistent with real human gaze shifting paths.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Spam has become the platform of choice used by cyber-criminals to spread malicious payloads such as viruses and trojans. In this paper, we consider the problem of early detection of spam campaigns. Collaborative spam detection techniques can deal with large scale email data contributed by multiple sources; however, they have the well-known problem of requiring disclosure of email content. Distance-preserving hashes are one of the common solutions used for preserving privacy of email content while enabling message classification for spam detection. However, distance-preserving hashes are not scalable, thus making large scale collaborative solutions difficult to implement. As a solution, we propose Spamdoop, a Big Data privacy-preserving collaborative spam detection platform built on top of a standard Map Reduce facility. Spamdoop uses a highly parallel encoding technique that enables the detection of spam campaigns in competitive times. We evaluate our system's performance using a huge synthetic spam base and show that our technique performs favorably against the creation and delivery overhead of current spam generation tools.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the rapid growth of video content, video summarization, which focuses on automatically selecting important and informative parts from videos, is becoming increasingly crucial. However, the problem is challenging due to its subjectiveness. Previous research, which predominantly relies on manually designed criteria or resourcefully expensive human annotations, often fails to achieve satisfying results. We observe that the side information associated with a video (e.g., surrounding text such as titles, queries, descriptions, comments, and so on) represents a kind of human-curated semantics of video content. This side information, although valuable for video summarization, is overlooked in existing approaches. In this paper, we present a novel Deep Side Semantic Embedding (DSSE) model to generate video summaries by leveraging the freely available side information. The DSSE constructs a latent subspace by correlating the hidden layers of the two uni-modal autoencoders, which embed the video frames and side information, respectively. Specifically, by interactively minimizing the semantic relevance loss and the feature reconstruction loss of the two uni-modal autoencoders, the comparable common information between video frames and side information can be more completely learned. Therefore, their semantic relevance can be more effectively measured. Finally, semantically meaningful segments are selected from videos by minimizing their distances to the side information in the constructed latent subspace. We conduct experiments on two datasets (Thumb1K and TVSum50) and demonstrate the superior performance of DSSE to several state-of-the-art approaches to video summarization.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>In the present work, the study on class imbalance problems in a distributed setting exploiting sparsity structure in the data has been carried out. We formulate the class-imbalance learning problem as a cost-sensitive learning problem with L1 regularization. The cost-sensitive loss function is a cost-weighted smooth hinge loss. The resultant optimization problem is minimized within the Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (DADMM) framework. We partition the data matrix across samples. This operation splits the original problem into a distributed L2 regularized smooth loss minimization and a L1 regularized squared loss minimization. L2 regularized subproblem is solved via Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) and random coordinate descent method in parallel at multiple processing nodes using MPI whereas L1 regularized problem is just a simple soft-thresholding operation. We show, empirically, that the distributed solution approximates the centralized solution on many benchmark data sets. The centralized solution is obtained via Cost-Sensitive Stochastic Coordinate Descent (CSSCD). Empirical results on small and large-scale benchmark datasets show some promising avenues to further investigate the real-world applications of the proposed algorithms such as anomaly detection, class-imbalance learning, etc. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to study class-imbalance in a distributed environment on large-scale sparse data.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Network communities, which are also known as network clusters, are typical latent structures in network data. Vertices in each of these communities tend to interact more and share similar features with each other. Community identification and feature summarization are significant tasks of network analytics. To perform either of the two tasks, there have been several approaches proposed, taking into the consideration different categories of information carried by the network, e.g., edge structure, node attributes, or both aforementioned. But few of them are able to discover communities and summarize their features simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose a novel latent factor model for community identification and summarization, which is named as LFCIS. To perform the task, LFCIS firstly formulates an objective function that evaluating the overall clustering quality taking into the consideration both edge topology and node features in the network. In the objective function, LFCIS also adopts an effective component that ensures those vertices sharing with both similar local structures and features to be located into the same clusters. To identify the optimal cluster membership for each vertex, a convergent algorithm for updating the variables in the objective function is derived and used by LFCIS. LFCIS has been tested with six sets of network data, including synthetic and real networks, and compared with several state-of-theart approaches. The experimental results show that, LFCIS outperforms most of the prevalent approaches to community discovery in social networks, and LFCIS is able to identify the latent features that may characterize those discovered communities.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>The Internet of Things (IoT) could become an important aspect of urban life in the next decade. In the IoT paradigm, various information and communication technologies (ICTs) are used in concert to substantially reduce urban problems. Smart cities and ubiquitous cities will adopt ICTs in the urban development process; however, IoT-based cities will experience considerably stronger effects than those that adopt conventional ICTs. IoT cities allow urban residents and &amp;#x201C;things&amp;#x201D; to be connected to the Internet by virtue of the extension the Internet Protocol from IPv4 to IPv6 and of cutting-edge device and sensor technology. Therefore, the urban transition resulting from the influence of IoT may be a critical issue. The privacy-related vulnerabilities of IoT technologies may negatively affect city residents. Furthermore, disparities in the spread of IoT systems across different countries may allow some countries to subvert the privacy of other countries&amp;#x2019; citizens. The aim of this study is to identify the potential prospects and privacy challenges that will emerge from IoT deployment in urban environments. This paper reviews the prospects of and barriers to IoT implementation at the regional, city and residential scales from the perspectives of security and privacy. IoT technology will be a continual presence in life in general and in urban life in particular. However, the adoption of the IoT paradigm in cities will be complicated due to the inherent presence of unsecured connections. Moreover, IoT systems may rob people of some of their humanity, infringing on their privacy, because people are also regarded as &amp;#x201C;things&amp;#x201D; in the IoT paradigm. Given the social trepidation surrounding IoT implementation, local and international associations related to IoT privacy, as well as legislation and international laws, are needed to maintain the personal right to privacy and to - atisfy the demands of institutional privacy in urban contexts.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>We present Oasis, a novel system for automatically generating immersive and interactive virtual reality environments for single and multiuser experiences. Oasis enables real-walking in the generated virtual environment by capturing indoor scenes in 3D and mapping walkable areas. It makes use of available depth information for recognizing objects in the real environment which are paired with virtual counterparts to leverage the physicality of the real world, for a more immersive virtual experience. Oasis allows co-located and remotely located users to interact seamlessly and walk naturally in a shared virtual environment. Experiencing virtual reality with currently available devices can be cumbersome due to presence of objects and furniture which need to be removed every time the user wishes to use VR. Our approach is new, in that it allows casual users to easily create virtual reality environments in any indoor space without rearranging furniture or requiring specialized equipment, skill or training. We demonstrate our approach to overlay a virtual environment over an existing physical space through fully working single and multiuser systems implemented on a Tango tablet device.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Visual exploration of flow fields is important for studying dynamic systems. We introduce semantic flow graph (SFG), a novel graph representation and interaction framework that enables users to explore the relationships among key objects (i.e., field lines, features, and spatiotemporal regions) of both steady and unsteady flow fields. The objects and their relationships are organized as a heterogeneous graph. We assign each object a set of attributes, based on which a semantic abstraction of the heterogeneous graph is generated. This semantic abstraction is SFG. We design a suite of operations to explore the underlying flow fields based on this graph representation and abstraction mechanism. Users can flexibly reconfigure SFG to examine the relationships among groups of objects at different abstraction levels. Three linked views are developed to display SFG, its node split criteria and history, and the objects in the spatial volume. For simplicity, we introduce SFG construction and exploration for steady flow fields with critical points being the only features. Then we demonstrate that SFG can be naturally extended to deal with unsteady flow fields and multiple types of features. We experiment with multiple data sets and conduct an empirical expert evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>As social networks are constantly changing and evolving, methods to analyze dynamic social networks are becoming more important in understanding social trends. However, due to the restrictions imposed by the social network service providers, the resources available to fetch the entire contents of a social network are typically very limited. As a result, analysis of dynamic social network data requires maintaining an approximate copy of the social network for each time period, locally. In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic network and text fetching with limited probing capacities, for identifying and maintaining influential users as the social network evolves. We propose an algorithm to probe the relationships (required for global influence computation) as well as posts (required for topic-based influence computation) of a limited number of users during each probing period, based on the influence trends and activities of the users. We infer the current network based on the newly probed user data and the last known version of the network maintained locally. Additionally, we propose to use link prediction methods to further increase the accuracy of our network inference. We employ PageRank as the metric for influence computation. We illustrate how the proposed solution maintains accurate PageRank scores for computing global influence, and topic-sensitive weighted PageRank scores for topic-based influence. The latter relies on a topic-based network constructed via weights determined by semantic analysis of posts and their sharing statistics. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms by comparing them with the true influence scores of the full and up-to-date version of the network, using data from the micro-blogging service Twitter. Results show that our techniques significantly outperform baseline methods (80% higher accuracy for network fetching and 77% for text fetching) and are superior to state-of-the-art techniques from the literature (21% higher ac- uracy).</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>With the proliferation of smart embedded devices, Cyber Physical Social Computing and Networking systems (CPSCN) are emerging as a next generation of social networks. Unlike traditional Social Networks that run on cloud-based infrastructure, CPSCN systems usually depend on a large number of distributed, heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones, smart vehicles or network access points. These computing resources, which are often referred to as fog computing systems, provide a gateway to the physical world, and thus offer new possibilities for social applications. Unfortunately, building CPSCN systems that leverage fog computing infrastructure is not straightforward. Significant challenges arise from the large scale distribution of computing resources over a wide area, and the dynamic nature of multiple, possibly mobile, hosts. In this paper, we extend our previous work on a Distributed Dataflow programming model and propose an application platform for realising CPSCN systems. A key aspect of our work is the development of an exogenous coordination model, which exhibits a separation of concern between computation and communication activities, and helps resolve some of the challenges brought about by the dynamic and large scale nature of CPSCN systems.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Many aesthetic models in multimedia and computer vision suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the low descriptiveness and interpretability of the hand-crafted aesthetic criteria (i.e., fail to indicate region-level aesthetics) and 2) the difficulty of engineering aesthetic features adaptively and automatically toward different image sets. To remedy these problems, we develop a deep architecture to learn aesthetically relevant visual attributes from Flickr, which are localized by multiple textual attributes in a weakly supervised setting. More specifically, using a bag-of-words representation of the frequent Flickr image tags, a sparsity-constrained subspace algorithm discovers a compact set of textual attributes (i.e., each textual attribute is a sparse and linear representation of those frequent image tags) for each Flickr image. Then, a weakly supervised learning algorithm projects the textual attributes at image-level to the highly-responsive image patches. These patches indicate where humans look at appealing regions with respect to each textual attribute, which are employed to learn the visual attributes. Psychological and anatomical studies have demonstrated that humans perceive visual concepts in a hierarchical way. Therefore, we normalize these patches and further feed them into a five-layer convolutional neural network to mimic the hierarchy of human perceiving the visual attributes. We apply the learned deep features onto applications like image retargeting, aesthetics ranking, and retrieval. Both subjective and objective experimental results thoroughly demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Every year 2.3 million people die worldwide due to occupational illnesses and accidents at work. By analyzing the workers' behavior when in the presence of risks managers could assign tasks to those workers who appear to be the most sensitive to risk being assigned and are thus more likely to exert more caution in the presence of that risk. This paper presents a novel multiobjective formulation of the personnel assignment problem, maximizing workers' sensitivity to risk, while minimizing cost and dislike for the task assigned. A worker's sensitivity to risk for a task is quantified by a new measure, carefulness, which stems from the worker's behavior and various human factors that affect the interaction with the risk. The problem is solved using a mixed evolutionary and multicriteria decision making methodology. An approximation of the Pareto front is first generated through the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II. A hybrid decisional approach then exploits the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution in order to select the Pareto-optimal solution that represents the nearest compromise to the decision-maker's preferences. These preferences are derived through a fuzzy version of the analytic hierarchy process. The proposed framework was tested in four real-world scenarios related to manufacturing companies. The results show a significant increase in overall carefulness and a strong decrease in the dislike for the task assigned, with a modest increase in cost. The framework thus improves the work climate and reduces the risk occurrence and/or the impact on the workers' health.</dcterms:abstract>

	abstract = {In the film industry, the ability to predict a movie’s box-office revenues before its theatrical release can decrease its financial risk. However, accurate predictions are not easily obtained. The complex relationship between movie-related data and movie box-office revenues, plus the increasing volume of data in online movie databases, pose challenges for their effective analysis. In this paper, a multimodal deep neural network, incorporating input about movie poster features learned in a data-driven fashion, is proposed for movie box-office revenues prediction. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is built to extract features from movie posters. By pre-training the CNN, features that are relevant to movie box-office revenues can be learned. To evaluate the performance of the proposed multimodal deep neural network, comparative studies with other prediction techniques were carried out on an Internet Movie Database dataset, and visualization of movie poster features was also performed. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multimodal deep neural network for movie box-office revenues prediction.},

	abstract = {Today, the use of social networks is growing ceaselessly and rapidly. More alarming is the fact that these networks have become a substantial pool for unstructured data that belong to a host of domains, including business, governments and health. The increasing reliance on social networks calls for data mining techniques that is likely to facilitate reforming the unstructured data and place them within a systematic pattern. The goal of the present survey is to analyze the data mining techniques that were utilized by social media networks between 2003 and 2015. Espousing criterion-based research strategies, 66 articles were identified to constitute the source of the present paper. After a careful review of these articles, we found that 19 data mining techniques have been used with social media data to address 9 different research objectives in 6 different industrial and services domains. However, the data mining applications in the social media are still raw and require more effort by academia and industry to adequately perform the job. We suggest that more research be conducted by both the academia and the industry since the studies done so far are not sufficiently exhaustive of data mining techniques.},

One of them, the “Lifetime Post Consumers” model, was assessed using sensitivity analysis to understand how each of the seven input features influenced it (category, page total likes, type, month, hour, weekday, paid). The type of content was considered the most relevant feature for the model, with a relevance of 36\%. A status post captures around twice the attention of the remaining three types (link, photo, video). We have drawn a decision process flow from the “Lifetime Post Consumers” model, which by complementing the sensitivity analysis information may be used to support manager's decisions on whether to publish a post.},

Less than a quarter of the libraries had more than 2000 post-related likes, and only seven received more than 100 comments on their postings. Content analysis identified the most prevalent single word (unigrams), bigrams (two-word sequences), and trigrams (three-word sequences) in high and low engagement content. Semantic analysis identified the semantic categories for posts with high and low engagement. The findings can assist academic libraries in their social media strategies for engagement, marketing, and visibility.},

None of us can deny to the fact it is not only the source of communication or connection between friends but also has broaden its horizons to politics, television industry, source to advertisement for companies, education and many more[11][15]. Most of the companies or personalities are maintaining pages on these social media sites to interact with the users of these sites they are even posting messages, videos on these sites so that they can get attached by more and more users. Researches have shown even in latest 2014 elections that BJP used social media as its most liked option for promotion. The same was hit and liked by masses. Seeing this we can actually see the acceptance of 'Like' on the social media. It has become a measure to actually analyze and capture user interest on social media. It enables one to actually calculate and measure the user liking over certain objects. It gives the clear cut idea of user interest in a particular object and thus calculations can be made accordingly for sharing and promoting information or objects on social media sites [12]. We are trying to seek a model to analyze and mine the influence of 'Like' in social media. To calculate the effect on the object 'Like' mining algorithm is proposed along with the network model for social media. Facebook data is being used to show the influence and effect of the approach.},

	abstract = {The explosive usage of social media produces massive amount of unlabeled and high-dimensional data. Feature selection has been proven to be effective in dealing with high-dimensional data for efficient learning and data mining. Unsupervised feature selection remains a challenging task due to the absence of label information based on which feature relevance is often assessed. The unique characteristics of social media data further complicate the already challenging problem of unsupervised feature selection, e.g., social media data is inherently linked, which makes invalid the independent and identically distributed assumption, bringing about new challenges to unsupervised feature selection algorithms. In this paper, we investigate a novel problem of feature selection for social media data in an unsupervised scenario. In particular, we analyze the differences between social media data and traditional attribute-value data, investigate how the relations extracted from linked data can be exploited to help select relevant features, and propose a novel unsupervised feature selection framework, LUFS, for linked social media data. We systematically design and conduct systemic experiments to evaluate the proposed framework on data sets from real-world social media Web sites. The empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of our proposed framework.},

In this study, we also investigated the influence of system specific feature set and user generated features of social media articles to identify relevant data mining algorithms that are suitable for identifying knowledge-related patterns in dataset. Among the classification methods it is found that Bayesian algorithm performs better compared to other classification techniques. K-Means and Filtered cluster among the clustering techniques have better predictive analytics efficiency compared to other algorithms.

	abstract = {Web 2.0 technologies have brought new ways of connecting people in social networks for collaboration in various on-line communities. Social Computing is a novel and emerging computing paradigm that involves a multi-disciplinary approach in analyzing and modeling social behaviors on different media and platforms to produce intelligent and interactive applications and results. In this paper, we give a brief survey of the various machine learning and computational techniques used in Social Computing by first examining the social platforms, e.g., social network sites, social media, social games, social bookmarking, and social knowledge sites, where computational methodology is required to collect, extract, process, mine, and visualize the data. We then present surveys on more specific instances of computation tasks and techniques, e.g., social network analysis, link modeling and mining, ranking, sentiment analysis, etc., that are being used on these social platforms to obtain desirable results. Lastly, we present a small subset of an extensive reference list, which contains over 140 highly relevant references relating to the recent development in the computational aspects of Social Computing.},

	abstract = {As data is growing rapidly day by day due to wide usage of social media, this social data will help business analyst as well as researchers to get the feedback about any service or product. Analysis of social media data can be used for many purposes like friend recommendation, product or service recommendation etc. There is need of such algorithms which will classify data accurately and will provide analysis results accurately. Also these algorithms need to scale rapidly with data sets. In this paper, Different phases of social media data mining are identified. We have studied algorithms whose training time remains same though the data size increases. We have implemented decision tree algorithm and compared it with other machine learning algorithms like NaiveBayes, Adaboost etc. It is found that decision tree algorithms gives accurate results as compared to other algorithms. In addition to that, out of different decision tree algorithms random decision tree (RDT) algorithm performs best than other decision tree algorithms like C4.5 or ID3.},

To acquire knowledge we have to analyze the unlimited data that is available to us in various formats in the form of databases. We can analyze this data and find hidden information with the support of data mining. Data mining refers to the process or method that extracts interesting knowledge from large amounts of data. Data mining have number of applications and these applications have enhanced the various fields of human life including business, education, social media medical, scientific etc. The field of data mining has seen enormous success from the inception, in terms of wide-ranging application achievements and in terms of scientific advancement and understanding. The key objective of this paper is to provide an overview of evolution of data mining from its beginning to the present stage of development.},

While dealing with big data it's difficult for traditional databases and architecture to modify, grill and then structure this data, it can lead to many consumer insights which can help to create win-win situations. It has become necessary to find out value from large data sets to show relationships, dependencies as well as to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors. Big Data has been characterized by 5 Vs - Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value. This paper deals with all these 5Vs, features, challenges, future of Big Data in social media arena using data mining algorithms, tools and Hadoop framework for overcoming challenges of Big Data.},

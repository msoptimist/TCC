AB  - CISTI (Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies) is a technical and scientific annual event dating back to 2006, whose purpose is to present and discuss knowledge, new perspectives, experiences and innovations in the Information Systems and Technologies domain (IST). The dynamics associated with IST together with the growing interest of the global community in CISTI have resulted in many topics and articles published in each conference, justifying a comprehensive analysis of the literature published. In this study, we present such analysis encompassing the last four editions, between 2013 and 2016, and a total of 677 articles. To accomplish such challenge more efficiently, we adopted text mining. We assessed through topic modeling how the unveiled research trends are aligned with the main conference themes. Data-driven empirical research has proven it is still a hot subject for researchers. Likewise, education and learning are also playing a significant role in CISTI's contributions. Notwithstanding, Internet and social media are highly relevant topics for the conference, although not figuring as major themes. On the other side, health is receiving less attention. Thus, this study can lead to recommendations for future CISTI's themes, in addition to providing an overview of current research trends.

AB  - The detection of topic trends has increasingly attracted interest over the past decades, fueled in particular by the revolution of internet and the emergence of social media. However, manual topic detection and tracking (TDT) is not efficient, this has become possible thanks to the development of modern data mining techniques and their flexibility to model potential issues. A critical challenge in this context is the representation choices of news stories along with adequate detection of new topics. To this end, we propose a unified statistical framework that allows simultaneous topic clustering and feature (word) selection in online settings based on spherical mixtures. Through empirical experiments, the proposed framework demonstrates the ability to learn new topics incrementally and improve detection quality within a reasonable time framework on diverse high-dimensional datasets.

AB  - There is increasing interest in sharing the experience of products and services on the web platform, and social media has opened a way for product and service providers to understand their consumers needs and expectations. This paper explores reviews by cloud consumers that reflect consumers experiences with cloud services. The reviews of around 6,000 cloud service users were analysed using sentiment analysis to identify the attitude of each review, and to determine whether the opinion expressed was positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis used two data mining tools, KNIME and RapidMiner, and the results were compared. We developed four prediction models in this study to predict the sentiment of users reviews. The proposed model is based on four supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Nave Bayes, Random Tree, and Random Forest. The results show that the Random Forest predictions achieve 97.06% accuracy, which makes this model a better prediction model than the other three.

AB  - Cluster based techniques on sentiment analysis is a novel approach for analyzing sentiments expressed in social media sites. It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique used in machine learning. In contrast to supervised learning technique, the cluster based techniques produce essentially accurate experimental results without manual processing, linguistic knowledge or training time. This paper presents a novel fuzzy clustering model to analyze twitter feeds regarding the sentiments of a particular brand using the real dataset collected over a period of one year. Then a comparative analysis is made with the existing partitioning clustering techniques namely K Means and Expectation Maximization algorithms based on metrics namely accuracy, precision, recall and execution time. According to the experimental analysis, the proposed approach is tested to be practicable in performing high quality twitter sentiment analysis results.

AB  - Opioid (e.g., heroin and morphine) addiction has become one of the largest and deadliest epidemics in the United States. To combat such deadly epidemic, there is an urgent need for novel tools and methodologies to gain new insights into the behavioral processes of opioid addiction and treatment. In this paper, we design and develop an intelligent system named iOPU to automate the detection of opioid users from Twitter. In iOPU, to model the users and posted tweets as well as their rich relationships, we first introduce a structured heterogeneous information network (HIN) for representation. Then we use meta-graph based approach to characterize the semantic relatedness over users. Afterwards, we integrate content-based similarity (i.e., similarity of users' posted tweets) and relatedness depicted by each meta-graph to formulate a similarity measure over users. Further we build a classifier combining different similarities based on different meta-graphs to make predictions. Comprehensive experiments on real sample collections from Twitter are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our developed system iOPU in opioid user detection by comparisons with other baseline methods. The results also demonstrate that knowledge from daily-life social media data mining could promote the practice of Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) in opioid addiction.

AB  - As one of the largest Social Media in providing public data every day, Twitter has attracted the attention of researcher to investigate, in order to mine public opinion, which is known as Sentiment Analysis. Consequently, many techniques and studies related to Sentiment Analysis over Twitter have been proposed in recent years. However, there is no study that discuss about sentence pattern of positive/negative sentence and neither subjective/objective sentence. In this paper we propose POS sequence as feature to investigate pattern or word combination of tweets in two domains of Sentiment Analysis: subjectivity and polarity. Specifically we utilize Information Gain to extract POS sequence in three forms: sequence of 2-tags, 3-tags, and 5-tags. The results reveal that there are some tendencies of sentence pattern which distinguish between positive, negative, subjective and objective tweets. Our approach also shows that feature of POS sequence can improve Sentiment Analysis accuracy.

AB  - With the rapid development of social media and e-commerce on the Internet, many short texts such as instant messages, tweets and product comments have become an important form of Internet information. Compared with regular texts, short texts suffer severe data sparsity and informal format. Because of that, mining latent semantics such as topics in short texts is a critical challenge. There are many limitations directly applying common topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to short texts. In result of that, many short text topic models were put forward. The Word Network Topic Model (WNTM) is the typical one among them, which transfers sparse document to word space into dense word to word space and then learn topics from it. However, WNTM has its own limitation. The word co-occurrence matrix of the original document is used to construct the word network. This method is simple and intuitive, which can't express the deep meaning between words and words. To solve this problem, we proposed W2V-WNTM, which uses Word2Vec model instead of word co-occurrence to construct word network. Experiment shows it can describe relationship between words better.

AB  - The papers in this special section focus on the topic of Big Data. There has been an explosive increase in media data, such as images, videos and social media in the Internet, mobile devices, and desktops. Accordingly, the area of big media data has been attracting a lot of research interest from both academia and industry. Big media data offers a promising possibility for in-depth media understanding, as well as exploring the very big scale media data to bridge the well-known semantic gap between high-level semantics and low-level features. It provides richer information, ranging from social relations to context information associated to rich media data of diverse modalities. It also provides us the opportunity to mine reliable and helpful knowledge from big media data for a wide variety of applications.

AB  - With the advance of the Web 2.0 era came an explosive growth of geographical multimedia data shared on social network websites such as Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, and Zooomr. Location-aware media description, modeling, learning, and recommendation in pervasive social media analytics have become a key focus of the recent research in computer vision, multimedia, and signal processing societies. A new breed of multimedia applications that incorporates image/video annotation, visual search, content mining and recommendation, and so on may revolutionize the field. Combined with the popularity of location-aware social multimedia, location context data makes traditionally challenging problems more tractable. This special issue brings together active researchers to share recent progress in this exciting area. This issue highlights the latest developments in large-scale multiple evidence-based learning for geosocial multimedia computing and identifies several key challenges and potential innovations.

AB  - With the Internet, social media, wireless mobile devices, and pervasive sensors continuously collecting massive amounts of data, we undoubtedly live in an era of “data deluge.” Learning from such huge volumes of data however, promises ground-breaking advances in science and engineering along with consequent improvements in quality of life. Indeed, mining information from big data could limit the spread of epidemics and diseases, identify trends in financial and e-markets, unveil topologies and dynamics of emergent social-computational systems, accelerate brain imaging, neuroscience and systems biology models, and also protect critical infrastructure including the power grid and the Internet's backbone network. While Big Data can be definitely perceived as a big blessing, big challenges also arise with large-scale datasets. Given these challenges, ample signal processing opportunities arise. The articles in this special section explore novel modeling approaches, algorithmic advances along with their performance analysis, as well as representative applications of Big Data analytics to address practical challenges, while revealing fundamental limits and insights on the analytical trade-offs involved.

AB  - A study of the impact of social media on societal stability can begin with various cybermovement organizations (CMO) as well as their formation, structure, development, and internal and external dynamics. We have witnessed several CMOs emerging from Facebook and Twitter that they have played significant roles in social change, serving as grassroots campaigns in political elections and as an organizational tool in the recent Middle East revolution. To deal with the huge amount of Web data involved, many AI methods and tools addressed by this magazine, such as social networking, data mining, machine learning, language processing, and text and content analysis, are essential for the success of such a study.

AB  - Summary form only given. The pervasive use of Online Social Networks (OSN) for networking, communication and search in tandem with the ubiquitous availability of smartphones, which enables real-time multimedia capturing and sharing, have led to massive amounts of user-generated content and activities being amassed online, and made publicly available for analysis and mining. Each content item is associated with an abundance of metadata and related information such as location, tags, comments, favorites and mood indicators, access logs, and so on. At the same time, all this information is implicitly or explicitly interconnected based on various properties such as social links among users, groups, communities, and sharing patterns. These properties transform social media into data sources of an extremely dynamic nature that reflect topics of interests, events, and the evolution of community opinion and focus. Social media processing offers a unique opportunity to structure and extract information and to benefit multiple areas ranging from new media experiences to psychology and marketing. The objective of this talk is to provide an overview of the current research in emerging topics related to applications where social media can act as sensors of real-life phenomena and case studies that reveal valuable insights. After discussing challenges and presenting a generic conceptual architecture, there will be a focus on efficient processing and indexing algorithms that can handle massive amounts of content with application to graph-based event detection and summarization in social media streams.

AB  - Data mining of network data often focuses on classification methods from machine learning, statistics, and pattern recognition perspectives. These techniques have been described by many, but many of these researchers are unaware of the rich history of classification and clustering techniques originating in social network analysis. The growth of rich social media, on-line communities, and collectively produced knowledge resources has greatly increased the need for good analytic techniques for social networks. We now have the opportunity to analyze social network data at unprecedented levels of scale and temporal resolution; this has led to a growing body of research at the intersection of the computing, statistics, and the social and behavioral sciences. This talk discusses some of the current challenges in the analysis of large-scale social network data, focusing on the inference of social processes from data. The invasion of network science by computer scientists has produced much interesting, both good and bad, research.

AB  - The articles in this special section focus on computational intelligence for big social data analytics. In the eras of social connectedness and social colonization, people are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about interacting, sharing, and collaborating through online collaborative media. In recent years, this collective intelligence has spread to many different areas, with particular focus on fields related to everyday life such as commerce, tourism, education, and health, causing the size of the Social Web to expand exponentially. The distillation of knowledge from such a large amount of unstructured information, however, is an extremely difficult task, as the contents of today's Web are perfectly suitable for human consumption, but remain hardly understandable to machines. Big social data analysis grows out of this need and combines multiple disciplines such as social network analysis, multimedia management, social media analytics, trend discovery, and opinion mining.

AB  - Spatial trajectory data is widely available today. Over a sustained period of time, trajectory data has been collected from numerous GPS devices, smartphones, sensors and social media applications. How do we manage them? What values can a business derive from them, and how? Due to their very large volumes, the nature of streaming itself, highly variable levels of data quality, as well as many possible links with other types of data, making sense of spatial trajectory data is one of the crucial areas for big data analytics. In this talk, we will introduce this increasingly important research area in the context of new applications, new problems and new opportunities. We will discuss recent advances in trajectory data management and trajectory mining, from their foundations to high performance processing with modern computing infrastructures.

AB  - An unexpected increase in the application of social web sites has led to the need in development of a very robustful and trust worthy systems and varied machinery forms in order to analyze such large forms of data and their ware houses which is being collected from various industries. We are always eager and excited to know what people think what they feel and perceive about various aspects of living and non-living beings. In need to understand and analyze various traits of behavior and the varying personality there is a need of opinion mining. It is a collection of all the extracted information from all the available resources and possible instances which could be in the form of hidden emotions, paragraphs and could be text, urban language and various un-identified representations. It is not only related topics like sensex, politics, finance and other meaningful words, but represents many things in the wide area of application. Almost all the sites have provided the option to display and present various medias and their views on various real life events. They can share various aspects of philosophy too and many more. They can represent various opinions on various streams of life which has really become crucial in our daily life to analyze the pattern in which things are exponentially growing. This research paper provides you with sentimental analysis of various smart phone opinions on smart phones dividing them Positive, Negative and Neutral Behavior. This is basically being obtained by studying the various posts being posted by varied number of users considering their areas of interest categorizing the smart phones. Analysis of plenty of words coupled in a sentence represent various sentiments of users and the various experiences and impact that product has given them. This analysis compiles a structural modeling approach and Bayesian Interface system to identify the polarity of the opinion which subsequently classifies positive and negative opinions.

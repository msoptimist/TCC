AB  - Exponential burst of real-time information generated through Social Media Networks in recent years, creates a hot ubiquitous platform for research among data scientists. Main area under spotlight in Social Networks Analysis (SNA) is friendship networks, user influence and computation of how deep and how fast the information diffuses. Amidst recent upsurge in Smartphone usage statistics, there is spectacular rise in tagging of feeds and post them with locations due to GPS localizations (Geo-tags and location coordinates of images and news feeds). For the local advertisers and social campaigners, it is vital to carve out phase based user reach models in a particular city/location. In this paper, an algorithm to calculate real-time geo influence of twitter users pertaining to location and time constraints is proposed and necessitate its requirement to meet the vital requisite to find out how fast information is spread by a particular user in a certain city/area and hence providing a platform for ranking them based on their influence in a particular place, and measuring speed of information travel. Subject Descriptors-Data mining and social computing, Social and Behavioural Sciences.

AB  - Every day, vast amounts of data are uploaded to various social-sharing websites. Each social-sharing website has its own media dataset. Recently, mining media datasets has shown great potential for our daily lives, e.g., earthquake detection. Generally, different datasets have different characteristics. Combining different datasets is capable of achieving better performance than using any dataset independently, particularly if the datasets can compensate for each other. The resulting performance, however, depends on the fusion method. Effectively combining different datasets is challenging. As a solution to this challenge, this paper presents a generic two-stage framework for events of interest. Specifically, the first stage normalizes the contents of different datasets to make them comparable; then, the second stage combines the normalized contents for a ranked event list using graph-based algorithms. Practically, this paper unifies a flow-based media dataset and a check-in-based media dataset. Based on the precision for the top n events, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better performance in finding events associated with sports, local festivals, concerts, and exhibitions compared with a state-of-the-art approach that uses one dataset alone.

AB  - Following the rapid evolution of Web 2.0, Sentiment Analysis has become one of the major techniques for mining the social media content. It aims to analyze opinions, sentiments, attitudes, and emotions towards entities such as topics, products, organizations, individuals, communities, and services. This paper presents SentiRobo, a supervised machine learning approach for the process of Sentiment Analysis. An enhanced version of Naive Bayes algorithm is introduced to predict the sentiment polarity of social media large data sets. Empirical evaluation over different twitter datasets with more than 300,000 records reveals the merit of this approach in processing of social media datasets.

AB  - Victims, volunteers, and relief organizations are increasingly using social media to report and act on large-scale events, as witnessed in the extensive coverage of the 2010–2012 Arab Spring uprisings and 2011 Japanese tsunami and nuclear disasters. Twitter® feeds consist of short messages, often in a nonstandard local language, requiring novel techniques to extract relevant situation awareness data. Existing approaches to mining social media are aimed at searching for specific information, or identifying aggregate trends, rather than providing narratives. We present CrisisTracker, an online system that in real time efficiently captures distributed situation awareness reports based on social media activity during large-scale events, such as natural disasters. CrisisTracker automatically tracks sets of keywords on Twitter and constructs stories by clustering related tweets on the basis of their lexical similarity. It integrates crowdsourcing techniques, enabling users to verify and analyze stories. We report our experiences from an 8-day CrisisTracker pilot deployment during 2012 focused on the Syrian civil war, which processed, on average, 446,000 tweets daily and reduced them to consumable stories through analytics and crowdsourcing. We discuss the effectiveness of CrisisTracker based on the usage and feedback from 48 domain experts and volunteer curators.

AB  - Nowadays, social media has become a massive real-time source of fresh information. Which gather a large volume of data produced every day to analysts who wish to discover new opportunities in the emerging research area of mining the noisy corpus present in social media. However, the noisy and short nature of this kind of text hamper this desire: unlike structured news content, social media users often prefer communicating unconventionally with informal, and ungrammatical language using abbreviations, slang, misspelled words, or non-standard short-forms: noisy words. Under those purposes, it becomes a challenge to present new methods to boost the performance of existing systems which convert this noisy text to Standard English. Most previous work didn't encompass all kinds of casual English noise, or made a strong assumption that the best canonical candidate is the one present in the correction dictionaries. This is not realistic because one noisy word can have different meanings considering the context, the area of interest and the time period of those noisy words extraction. In this paper, we target all kinds of casual English noise neglected by state-of-art by proposing a novel weakly supervised approach. This one takes into account the context, the type of interest of those noisy words and their time period of extraction: Once the informal word is identified, we recognize its type of interest by surrounding its context. Then, we generate the best and highly ranked canonical form depending on the extraction time period of the noisy word. Finally, we normalize the noisy word. This multi-faceted, context aware, and interest sensitive approach is expected to yield more accurate results than existing state-of-art solutions.

AB  - Stream mining has gained popularity in recent years due to the availability of numerous data streams from sources such as social media and sensor networks. Data mining on such continuous streams possess a variety of challenges including concept drift and unbounded stream length. Traditional data mining approaches to these problems have difficulty incorporating relational domain knowledge and feature relationships, which can be used to improve the accuracy of a classifier. In this work, we model large data streams using statistical relational learning techniques for classification, in particular, we use a Markov Logic Network to capture relational features in structured data and show that this approach performs better for supervised learning than current state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we evaluate our approach with semi-supervised learning scenarios, where class labels are only partially available during training.

AB  - With the development of social media applications, short text mining is becoming more and more important. Due to the sparseness of short text data, both the feature correlation information (word co-occurrence) and data contiguity information (context information) are less reliable, thus most existing text mining methods which are designed to address regular text data are less efficient in short text mining tasks. According to our observation from analysis of discriminative term distribution in short text data, we found that discriminative terms distribute in a non-uniform way among different domains, while background words have a tendency to distribute uniformly. This observation can be measured by a suitably defined functional of a term's probability distribution over different domains. In this paper, we adopt this distribution as the weight of terms to address the sparseness problem of short text data. We evaluate our method on two datasets, and experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches which require information infusion, and a number of state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Furthermore, our method can obtain a more coherent clustering result.

AB  - People always spend their time at a few important locations for various activities in groups during specific time slots, called place of activity (POA), e.g., resting at home among family members during night and working at office among colleagues during work time. Inferring such places is significant for not only the precise advertising on the commercial aspect but the identifying rallies or meetings among a group of people and tracking of the target individuals on the aspect of public security, e.g., locating and tracking suspected terrorists for anti-terrorist work. However, it is a challenge to map from big location data to places of activity due to the volume and complexity whilst giving rise to privacy concerns, e.g., personally important place mining. In the paper, a method for POA mining on big location data is proposed, named P-PAM, aiming at big data analytics and privacy concerns. We use a clustering algorithm to discover the place of activity, then adopt location entropy as reference of user diversity and take into account temporal variation, to infer place of activity. Further, robust privacy-preserving mechanisms under differential privacy are embedded into clustering results and location entropy evaluation that accesses to raw location data. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach with large-scale location datasets derived from geo-referenced social media. The experimental results suggest that the POA mining approach can successfully scale to big data scenarios whilst preserving individual user privacy.

AB  - Innovations around "Big Data" can be characterized in terms of rapid technology development and deployment dynamics. For this purpose, combining "tech mining" (extraction of usable intelligence) from publication and patent databases with tech mining of business-related databases can elucidate activities and interests of business communities regarding Big Data innovation pathways. In this paper, we focus on commercially oriented databases -- ABI/INFORM as a source from which to extract business intents. We select the database to help gauge "hot topics" in industry with regard to Big Data. Our results show that certain types of firms can be clustered into thematic groups relating to Big Data discussions and activities. In the paper we demonstrate that such analyses can illuminate themes being pursued by businesses. Like social media analyses, this text mining can provide useful intelligence to inform more in-depth investigation mobilizing other data sources and techniques.

AB  - With the popularity of social media (e.g., Facebook and Flicker), users can easily share their check-in records and photos during their trips. In view of the huge number of user historical mobility records in social media, we aim to discover travel experiences to facilitate trip planning. When planning a trip, users always have specific preferences regarding their trips. Instead of restricting users to limited query options such as locations, activities, or time periods, we consider arbitrary text descriptions as keywords about personalized requirements. Moreover, a diverse and representative set of recommended travel routes is needed. Prior works have elaborated on mining and ranking existing routes from check-in data. To meet the need for automatic trip organization, we claim that more features of Places of Interest (POIs) should be extracted. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient Keyword-aware Representative Travel Route framework that uses knowledge extraction from users' historical mobility records and social interactions. Explicitly, we have designed a keyword extraction module to classify the POI-related tags, for effective matching with query keywords. We have further designed a route reconstruction algorithm to construct route candidates that fulfill the requirements. To provide befitting query results, we explore Representative Skyline concepts, that is, the Skyline routes which best describe the trade-offs among different POI features. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, we have conducted extensive experiments on real location-based social network datasets, and the experiment results show that our methods do indeed demonstrate good performance compared to state-of-the-art works.

AB  - As people continue to author and share increasing amounts of information in social media, the opportunity to leverage such information for relationship discovery tasks increases. In this paper, we describe a set of systems that mine, aggregate, and infer a social graph from social media inside an enterprise, resulting in over 73 million relationships between 450,000 people. We then describe SaNDVis, a novel visual analytics tool that supports people-centric tasks like expertise location, team building, and team coordination in the enterprise. We also provide details of a 12-month-long, large-scale deployment to almost 1,800 users from which we extract dominant use cases from log and interview data. By integrating social position, evidence, and facets into SaNDVis, we demonstrate how users can use a visual analytics tool to reflect on existing relationships as well as build new relationships in an enterprise setting.

AB  - In the age of data processing, news videos are rich mines of information. After all, the news are essentially created to convey information to the public. But can we go beyond what is directly presented to us and see a wider picture? Many works already focus on what we can discover and understand from the analysis of years of news broadcasting. These analysis bring monitoring and understanding of the activity of public figures, political strategies, explanation and even prediction of critical media events. Such tools can help public figures in managing their public image, as well as support the work of journalists, social scientists and other media experts. News analysis can be also seen from the lens of complex systems, gathering many types of entities, attributes and interactions over time. As many public figures intervene in different news stories, a first interesting task is to observe the social interactions between these actors. Towards this goal, we propose to use video analysis to automatise the process of constructing social networks directly from news video archives. In this paper we are introducing a system deriving multiple social networks from face detections in news video. We present preliminary results obtained from analysis of these networks monitoring of the activity of more than a hundred public figures over a decade of the NHK news archives.

AB  - As people continue to author and share increasing amounts of information in social media, the opportunity to leverage such information for relationship discovery tasks increases. In this paper, we describe a set of systems that mine, aggregate, and infer a social graph from social media inside an enterprise, resulting in over 73 million relationships between 450,000 people. We then describe SaNDVis, a novel visual analytics tool that supports people-centric tasks like expertise location, team building, and team coordination in the enterprise. We provide details of a 22-month-long, large-scale deployment to over 2,300 users from which we analyze longitudinal usage patterns, classify types of visual analytics queries and users, and extract dominant use cases from log and interview data. By integrating social position, evidence, and facets into SaNDVis, we demonstrate how users can use a visual analytics tool to reflect on existing relationships as well as build new relationships in an enterprise setting.

AB  - The overflow of data is a critical contemporary challenge in many areas such as hyper-spectral sensing, information retrieval, biotechnology, social media mining, classification etc. It is usually manifested by a high dimensional representation of data observations. In most cases, the information that is inherent in high-dimensional datasets is conveyed by a small number of parameters that correspond to the actual degrees of freedom of the dataset. In order to efficiently process the dataset, one needs to derive these parameters by embedding the dataset into a low-dimensional space. This process is commonly referred to as dimensionality reduction or feature extraction. We present a novel algorithm for dimensionality reduction - diffusion bases - which explores the connectivity among the coordinates of the data and is dual to the diffusion maps algorithm. The algorithm reduces the dimensionality of the data while maintaining the coherency of the information that is conveyed by the data.

AB  - While multimedia and social computing research have used crowdsourcing techniques to annotate objects, actions, and scenes in social video sites like YouTube, little work has addressed the crowdsourcing of personal and social traits in online social video or social media content in general. In this paper, we address the problems of (1) crowdsourcing the annotation of first impressions of video bloggers (vloggers) personal and social traits in conversational YouTube videos, and (2) mining the impressions with the goal of modeling the interplay of different vlogger facets. First, we design a human annotation task to crowdsource impressions of vloggers that extends a tradition of studies of personality impressions with the addition of attractiveness and mood impressions. Second, we propose a probabilistic framework using Topic Models to discover prototypical impressions that are data driven, and that combine multiple facets of vloggers. Finally, we address the task of automatically predicting topic impressions using nonverbal and verbal content extracted from videos and comments. Our study of 442 YouTube vlogs and 2,210 annotations collected in Mechanical Turk supports recent literature showing the feasibility to crowdsource interpersonal human impression with comparable quality to what is reported in social psychology research, and provides insights on the interplay among human first impressions. We also show that topic models are useful to discover meaningful prototypical impressions that can be validated by humans, and that different topics can be predicted using different sources of information from vloggers' nonverbal and verbal content, as well as comments from the audience.

AB  - This work reports about the preliminary results and ongoing research based upon profiling collaborative learning groups of persons within the social micro-blogging platforms like Twitter<sup>1</sup>that share potentially common interests on special topic. Hereby the focus is held on spontaneously initiated collaborative learning in Social Media and detection of collaborative learning groups based upon their communication dynamics. Research questions targeted to be answered are: are there any useful data mining algorithms to fulfill the task of pre-selection and clustering of users in social networks, how good do they perform, and what are the metrics that could be used for detection and evaluation in the realm of this task. Basic approach presented here uses as preamble hypothesis that users and their interests in Social Networks can be identified through content generated by them and content they consume. Special focus is held on topic oriented approach as least common bounding point. Those should be also the basic criteria used to detect and outline the learning groups. The aim of this work is to deliver first scientific pre-work for successfully implementation of recommender systems using social network metrics and content features of social network users for the purposes of better learning group communication and information consumption.

AB  - Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a technique for modeling the communication patterns between individuals in a way that illuminates the structure of the network and the importance of individuals within the network. SNA has gained a recent importance due to the appearance of various web 2.0 platforms like blogs, wikis, content and media sharing sites which consists of a huge collection of data. These data are vast, noisy, unstructured and dynamic in nature, so mining is performed on such data by various SNA methods and tools in order to extract actionable patterns which are useful for business, consumers, and users. This study is a part of the growing body of research on Social Network Analysis and uncovers hidden relationships in a facebook network. It gives a prospective view of the hidden attributes of the high degree nodes (users having greater number of friends) in the Facebook network. Results show that there is little association among high degree nodes.

In particular, people use Twitter to share information and experiences, express their opinions, and say how they feel. This wealth of data of how people feel and experience various events can provide valuable information to support mental health research. In this paper, we show how we can explore the emotional state of a population by mining the vast amount of available public social media data in real time. The We Feel system is able to capture and process up to 45,000 tweets per minute, and show their emotional content live in an interactive visualisation. The data can be used to explore how people respond to certain events and support mental health research.

AB  - Current technology facilitates and increases connections through social media, allowing individuals everywhere to spread their ideas to the world. One social media platform is Twitter. One characteristic of a tweet is the requirement of conveying a message in a limited number of words. Proverbs are a feature of language that convey messages effectively in the least number of words. Therefore, we selected the analysis of proverb usage in Arabic tweets. We collected and manually classified tweets with Arabic proverbs in order to develop a model, using data and text mining techniques, to understand the context of their usage in the tweets. Each tweet has two types of features: the external feature refers to the structured data behind tweets, and internal features refer to unstructured data in the tweet content, the "text of the tweet itself." According to the experimental results of this study, we found that internal features are best for assessing the context of Arabic proverb usage in tweets. The study is significant in that it can help understand the psychology of the Arab masses using and spreading their messages and ideas in the Twitter ecosystem.

AB  - Social Media is exploding with data - that can help you derive an optimal marketing strategy in the internet world, engage with your audience on the fly, and protect your reputation from smearing campaigns if it is processed and analyzed in a timely fashion. Digital marketing analysts and data scientists rely on social media analytics tools to deduce customer sentiment from countless opinions and reviews. While numerous attempts have been made to improve their accuracy in the past, yet we know surprisingly little about how accurate their results are. We present an unbiased study of users' tweets and the methods that leverage the available tools &amp; technologies for opinion mining. Our prime focus is on improving the consistency of text classifiers used for linguistic analysis. We also measure the impact of lexical richness in the sample data on the trained algorithm. This paper attempts to improve the reliability of sentiment classification process by the creation of a custom vote classifier using natural language processing techniques and various machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Intelligently extracting knowledge from social media has recently attracted great interest from the Biomedical and Health Informatics community to simultaneously improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs using consumer-generated opinion. We propose a two-step analysis framework that focuses on positive and negative sentiment, as well as the side effects of treatment, in users' forum posts, and identifies user communities (modules) and influential users for the purpose of ascertaining user opinion of cancer treatment. We used a self-organizing map to analyze word frequency data derived from users' forum posts. We then introduced a novel network-based approach for modeling users' forum interactions and employed a network partitioning method based on optimizing a stability quality measure. This allowed us to determine consumer opinion and identify influential users within the retrieved modules using information derived from both word-frequency data and network-based properties. Our approach can expand research into intelligently mining social media data for consumer opinion of various treatments to provide rapid, up-to-date information for the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, and medical staff, on the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of future treatments.

AB  - Social media interactions have become increasingly important in today's world. A survey conducted in 2014 among adult Americans found that a majority of those surveyed use at least one social media site. Twitter, in particular, serves 310 million active users on a monthly basis, and thousands of tweets are published every second. The public nature of this data makes it a prime candidate for data mining. Twitter users publish 140-character long messages and have the ability to geo-tag these tweets using a variety of methods: GPS coordinates, IP geolocation and user-declared location. However, few users disclose their location, only between 1% and 3% of users provide location data, according to our empirical findings. In this article, we aim to aggregate information from different sources to provide an estimation on the location of any Twitter user. We use an hybrid approach, using techniques in the fields of Natural Language Processing and network theory. Tests have been conducted on two datasets, inferring the location of each individual user and then comparing it against the actual known location of users with geolocation information. The estimation error is the distance in kilometers between the estimation and the actual location. Furthermore, there is a comparison of the relative average error per country, to account for difference in country sizes. Our results improve those presented in different researches in the literature. Our research has as feature to be independent of the language used by the user, while most of works in the literature use just one language or a reduced set of languages. The article also showcases the evolution of our estimation approach and the impact that the modifications had on the results.

AB  - Many consider “searching” a solved problem, and for digital text processing, this belief is factually based. The problem is that many “real world” search applications involve “complex documents”, and such applications are far from solved. Complex documents, or less formally, “real world documents”, comprise of a mixture of images, text, signatures, tables, etc., and are often available only in scanned hardcopy formats. Some of these documents are corrupted. Some of these documents, particularly of historical nature, contain multiple languages. Accurate search systems for such document collections are currently unavailable. We describe our efforts at building a complex document information-processing prototype. This prototype integrates “point solution” (mature) technologies, such as document readability enhancement, OCR capability, signature matching and handwritten word spotting techniques, search and mining approaches, among others, to yield a system capable of searching “real world documents”. The described prototype demonstrates the adage that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. Our previous complex document benchmark development efforts are likewise presented. Having described “real world” search issues, we focus on spelling correction in adverse environments. Two environments are discussed: foreign name search and medical term search. In support of the Yizkor Books project of the Archives Section of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, novel foreign name search approaches that favorably compare against the state of the art are developed. By segmenting names, fusing individual results, and filtering via a threshold, our approach statistically significantly improves traditional Soundex and n-gram based search techniques used in the search of such texts. Thus, previously unsuccessful searches are now supported. Using a similar approach, within the medical domain, automated term corrections are made to reduce transcription errors. Finally, we focus analyzing social media, an additional, non-traditional search environment. By searching and mining such data, unknown or unexpected trends are detected. We explore and demonstrate the validity of the approach in the healthcare space.

AB  - Designers in many fields rely on examples for inspiration, and examples play an important role in art and design curricula. Online media offer a corpus of examples at a scale and diversity never before seen. Design on the Web is not only large, it's also “at large.” This scale and diversity enable powerful new opportunities for learning, mining, understanding, and assessing design. My group's research tools harvest and synthesize examples to empower more people to design interactive systems, learners to acquire new skills, experts to be more creative, and programmers to engage in more design thinking. This research shapes my project-based design teaching, which emphasizes creating diverse alternatives, self-assessment, and using examples to provide design insights and teach abstract principles. To illustrate these opportunities — and the technical and social challenges — of design that is large and at-large, I'll focus on two recent projects in my group. The first explores peer assessment of design at a global scale. In 2012, we collaborated with Coursera to launch the first massive-scale class with self and peer assessment. This enabled online students to engage in open-ended design projects. It has also worked surprisingly well, and variants have since been used by more than 80 other massive online classes. The second project, Webzeitgeist, introduces a scalable platform for Web design mining. Applications built with this platform can dynamically curate design galleries, search for design alternatives, retarget content between page designs, and predict the semantic role of page elements from design data. In sharing this work, I'll try to impart some useful strategies and spark discussion on design research at large.

AB  - The use of the social media sites are growing rapidly to interact with the communities and to share the ideas among others. It may happen that most of the people dislike the ideas of others person views and make the use of the offensive language in their posts. Due to these offensive terms, many people especially youth and teenagers try to adopt such language and spread over the social media sites which may significantly affect the others people innocent minds. As offensive terms increasingly use by the people in highly manner, it is difficult to find or classify such offensive terms in real day to day life. To overcome from these problem, the proposed system analyze the offensive language and can classify the offensive sentence on a particular topic discussion using the support vector machine (SVM) as supervised classification in the data mining. The proposed system also can find the potential user by means of whom the offensive language spread among others and define the comparative analysis of SVM with Naive Bayes technique.

AB  - Some research proposes that age changing effects on learning performance. Although, age-related degraded perception cannot be rolled-back, it can be improved by training and learning. Since seniors can reach new technology slowly, social media is a way to support their participation in long term learning. However, the level of learning is limited by each personal background knowledge, that each senior supposes to have the learning path which mostly match with their social media knowledge. Therefore, this study proposes the method to classify groups of senior by using useful data mining algorithms. In this case, Random Forest and K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) model are used. The study conducted with 60 senior between 60-75 years old from seniors school in chiangrai province. Upon participants have done the pretest, these algorithms classifies an senior test results, and assign them into 4 appropriate groups, including Professional, Medium, Less Knowledge, and No Experience. The results show that both algorithms, Random Forest and K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) provide 95.56% and 93.33% accuracy respectively.

AB  - Tourist recommendation system are aimed at supporting the critical travel planning decisions the tourist face before starting the trip or on the course of travel. Users desire more efficient ways to find tourism recommendations which can save time and efforts. Geo-tagged photos on social media sites such as lickr provide plentiful location based data. Recently, there is an increased tendency to utilize the information contained in these geo-tagged photos for tourist recommendations. In this paper, we have proposed a framework for tourist recommendation. The proposed approach involves mining significant tourist locations and provide trip model based on the geo-tagged photos of users on social media sites.

AB  - This vision paper reviews the current state-ofart and lays out emerging research challenges in parallel processing of spatial-temporal large datasets relevant to a variety of scientific communities. The spatio-temporal data, whether captured through remote sensors (global earth observations), ground and ocean sensors (e.g., soil moisture sensors, buoys), social media and hand-held, traffic-related sensors and cameras, medical imaging (e.g., MRI), or large scale simulations (e.g., climate) have always been “big.” A common thread among all these big collections of datasets is that they are spatial and temporal. Processing and analyzing these datasets requires high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures. Various agencies, scientific communities and increasingly the society at large rely on spatial data management, analysis, and spatial data mining to gain insights and produce actionable plans. Therefore, an ecosystem of integrated and reliable software infrastructure is required for spatialtemporal big data management and analysis that will serve as crucial tools for solving a wide set of research problems from different scientific and engineering areas and to empower users with next-generation tools. This vision requires a multidisciplinary effort to significantly advance domain research and have a broad impact on the society. The areas of research discussed in this paper include (i) spatial data mining, (ii) data analytics over remote sensing data, (iii) processing medical images, (iv) spatial econometrics analyses, (v) Map-Reducebased systems for spatial computation and visualization, (vi) CyberGIS systems, and (vii) foundational parallel algorithms and data structures for polygonal datasets, and why HPC infrastructures, including harnessing graphics accelerators, are needed for time-critical applications.

Dealing with microblog data belongs to big data areas. The premise of which is to obtain a large amount of microblog data. For the commercial interests as well as security considerations, the access to the data is becoming increasingly difficult and the Sina officially open API doesn't support large data mining. In this paper, we try to design a platform that is mainly based on the access mechanism of Multi-strategy and existing resources to collect data stably from Sina microblog. The results demonstrate that a combination of API and web crawler allows efficient data mining. In this way, we confirmed that custom solutions will be allowed to build straightforward application of hot words searching and analysis.

AB  - Big data has deeply rendered into both research and commercial fields such as health care, business and banking sectors. Automated Adaptive and Sequential Recommendation of Travel Route handovers automated and adaptive travel sequence recommendation from large amount of travel data. Unlike any other travel recommendation methods, this method is not only automated it is personalized to user's travel interest but also able to recommend a travel sequence rather than individual Points of Interest (POIs). This method has large amount of travel data including different places, the distributions of cost, visiting time and visiting season of each topic is mined to bridge the gap between user travel preference and travel routes and we also have topical package space. Here we use advantage of the complementary social media: community- contributed photos and map both user interests and travel data descriptions to the topical package space to get user topical package model and route. Representative images with viewpoint and seasonal diversity of POIs are shown to offer a more extensive impression.

Databases of Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus are used to retrieve the relevant articles. The edge-betweenness clustering technique is applied to the citation network that is built from the retrieved data. The major research groups in the big data field are identified via the clustering. A word clouding is used to extract the major research themes of each group by calculating the frequencies of words used in the titles of articles. Eleven major and minor research themes are identified: "cloud computing", "data mining", "MapReduce", "privacy", "social media", "healthcare", "ethics and legal", "surveillance", "geography", "business intelligence", and "bioinformatics". The approaches presented in this paper can also be applied to any scientific or technological field.

AB  - This paper describes a solution for the improvement and support of decision-making processes in a reasonable time. It proposes and implements a suitable procedure based on appropriate methods and technologies to create a Web content mining application focused on the trend analysis. The following text describes used architecture, methods and data structures in the context of Web mining and the decision-making approaches. The resulted code runs as a timed script that handles different analyses over the selected Web sites - e.g. the most covered topics in the mass media servers, contexts of the top words based on the distance, saving outputs into the graph, etc. Authors are able to compare options and make decisions very fast, without reading the full contents of the sources. Object-oriented approach is used for the code writing so the code can be easily extended to handle number of different tasks (financial market decisions, crisis management, customer segmentation, social media monitoring, etc.). Real-time analysis of data from different Internet sources and a graphical visualization of results belong to the most important contributions of the proposed application.

AB  - The exponential development in online social media allows users around the globe the possibility to share and communicate information and ideas freely in different formats of data via internet. This emerging media has become a dominant communication tool and it has been used as a communication channel in several events, especially “The Arab Spring” and BOSTON'S attack etc. In order to develop useful profiles of different cybercriminals, text mining techniques is an effective way to detect and predict criminal activities in microblog posts taking account the problems of data sparseness and semantic gap. The hashtags used on Twitter (e.g., #arabspring, #BostonAttack) contains outstanding indicators to detect events and trending topics especially to target and detect suspicious topics and eventual illegal events. Similarity approach is used in text analysis to detect suspicious posts in microblog publications. The evaluation of our proposed approach is done within real posts.

AB  - Frequent pattern mining is one of the most important and fundamental tasks in data mining. While a large number of sophisticated techniques on frequent pattern mining are proposed, two essential drawbacks on frequent pattern mining, i.e. the explosion of discovered patterns and less comprehensibility of patterns, are still remained unsolved. In this paper, we propose an application of distributed representation to the area of frequent pattern mining in order to alleviate the drawbacks and to derive characteristic patterns with high understandability. More precisely, given a set of visual patterns derived from databases on tagged thumbnail images in social media, we attempt to identify characteristic visual patterns by the cluster analysis in the vector space obtained by distributed representation. In addition, to help understanding of the meanings of visual patterns, we associate plural tag patterns having similar vector representations with each visual pattern. A series of experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real tagged thumbnail images in Nicovideo(nicovideo.jp). The results confirm that the proposed framework can provide better vector representation of visual patterns compared with other dimensionality reduction techniques to identify characteristic patterns with high understandability.

AB  - The amount of citizens' participation and political involvement within democratic societies may vary from one person to another. Similarly, this diversity of political engagement of users might be observed in online platforms such as Twitter. Hence, considering their political-related online activity, they may be catalogued as highly politically active or poorly politically active citizens. The aim of this tutorial is to provide the ICEDEG audience with an overview on the use of social media data for E-Government and data mining strategies to model users' interests. Specifically, I will present an approach to measure their degree of interest in politics. In the first part of the tutorial, I will introduce the issues related to the supporting role of Online Social Networks (OSNs) in citizenship evolution. Then, we will see techniques employed to model users' preferences as well as tweets classification and clustering to do so. Considering Twitter as a widely studied platform in digital citizenship, I will present relevant works in the state of the art. In the second part of the tutorial we will analyze a case study taking the advantage of a demo. Finally, to conclude, I will present emerging aspects, open issues and challenges in this area.

AB  - Analytics companies develop the ability to support their decisions through analytic reasoning using a variety of statistical and mathematical techniques. Thomas Devonport in his book titled, "Competing on analytics: The new science of winning", claims that a significant proportion of high-performance companies have high analytical skills among their personnel. On the other hand, a recent study has also revealed that more than 59% of the organizations do not have information required for decision-making. Learning "Data Analysis with R" not only adds to existing analytics knowledge and methodology, but also equips with exposure into latest analytics techniques including forecasting, social media analytics, text mining &amp;amp; so on. It gives an opportunity to work on real time data from Twitter, Facebook &amp;amp; other social networking sites.

AB  - Drug repositioning represents the application of known drugs for new indications and plays an important role in healthcare research and industry. With its increasing value in drug development, multiple approaches have been applied in its exercise, basically classified as drug-based and diseasebased approaches. Our study adopted a disease-based approach and utilized Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) as an intermediary to associate drugs with diseases for drug repositioning. Based on the collected health-related social media data, we constructed a heterogeneous healthcare network and developed three path-mining techniques to identify significant associations between ADRs and diseases and then determine the associations between potential drugs and diseases for repositioning. When an ADR has a strong association with a disease based on the drugs indicated for the disease, there is an underlying mechanism-of-action (MOA) between the disease and the ADR. The ADR can be considered as a clinical phenotypic biomarker of the disease. Others drugs that have a strong association with the ADR are prospective for repositioning [12]. The experiment results demonstrate the repositioning capability of the proposed method and the advantages of using social media data. The case studies and the ratio of supporting articles show its effectiveness and the potential for further drug development research.

AB  - This paper proposes a rule based approach for sentiment analysis from Malayalam movie reviews. The research in Sentiment Analysis nowadays become one among active research areas in natural language processing. Sentiment Analysis is the cognitive process in which the user's feeling and emotions are extracted. The growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media such as reviews, forum discussions, blogs, and social networks. Sentiment analysis enables computers to automate the activities performed by human for making decisions based on the sentiment of opinions, which has wide applications in data mining, web mining, and text mining. Negation Rule has been applied for extracting the Sentiments from a given text. This system gives the polarity at the sentence level for the movie reviews with an accuracy of 85%, when analysed.

AB  - Sentiment analysis or opinion mining consist of many different fields like natural language processing, text mining, decision making and linguistics. It is a type of text analysis that classifies the text and makes decision by extracting and analyzing the text. Opinions can be categorized as positive and negative and measures the degree of positive or negative associated with that event (people, organization, social issues). So, it's basically people's opinion study, study of emotions and appraisals in the direction of any social issue, people or entity. Recently most of the researches have been done on the sentiment analysis of products and services. The analysis of events and issues, data is retrieved from social media like twitter etc.

AB  - The advent of social media is changing the existing information behavior by letting users access to real-time online information channels without the constraints of time and space. It also generates a huge amount of data worth discovering novel knowledge. Social media, therefore, has created an enormous challenge for scientists trying to keep pace with developments in their field. Most of the previous studies have adopted broad-brush approaches which tend to result in providing limited analysis. To handle these problems properly, we introduce our real-time Twitter trend mining system, RT<sup>2</sup>M, which operates in real-time to process big stream datasets available on Twitter. The system offers the functions of term co-occurrence retrieval, visualization of Twitter users by query, similarity calculation between two users, Topic Modeling to keep track of changes of topical trend, and analysis on mention-based user networks. We also demonstrate an empirical study on 2012 Korean presidential election. The case study reveals Twitter could be a useful source to detect and predict the advent and changes of social issues, and analysis of mention-based user networks could show different aspects of user behaviors.

AB  - The tax gives an important role for the contributions of the economy and development of a country. The improvements to the taxation service system continuously done in order to increase the State Budget. One of consideration to know the performance of taxation particularly in Indonesia is to know the public opinion as for the object service. Text mining can be used to know public opinion about the tax system. The rapid growth of data in social media initiates this research to use the data source as big data analysis. The dataset used is derived from Facebook and Twitter as a source of data in processing tax comments. The results of opinions in the form of public sentiment in part of service, website system, and news can be used as consideration to improve the quality of tax services. In this research, text mining is done through the phases of text processing, feature selection and classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM). To reduce the problem of the number of attributes on the dataset in classifying text, Feature Selection used the Information Gain to select the relevant terms to the tax topic. Testing is used to measure the performance level of SVM with Feature Selection from two data sources. Performance measured using the parameters of precision, recall, and F-measure.

AB  - Superficially free information services, such as social media platforms, search websites, and mobile apps. Earn revenue by collecting, aggregating, and monetizing user data. Users of these systems must give up control over this data in order to participate in the digital ecology. In a pilot study that queried the views of American university students, we explored the level of understanding young Americans have about data tracking and data mining and investigated some key value propositions about the perceived fairness of the "data-for-service" business model. Our study participants generally considered the exchange to be fair, but these feelings were nuanced, contextual, and somewhat plastic. Subjects frequently expressed distrust in the providers of popular information services. They also expressed reservations about current practices, particularly after learning more about data mining and user profiling during the focus group. We suggest that gender and age are factors in attitudes about privacy in digital environments.

AB  - The advances in location-acquisition and smart phone technologies have led to a myriad of location-based social media. Therefore, analyzing the increasing amount of spatio-temporal data emerges as an important topic. Most studies on geographic data mining focus on exploring static mobility patterns. As the amount of incoming data streams increases, revealing the temporal aspect of user mobility patterns is worth investigating. This paper targets on mining user mobility patterns over time (referred to as mobility evolution) from streams of check-in records. Intuitively, at each time slot, a mobility pattern indicates spatial regions where users stay. Therefore, given a set of time slots, mobility evolution refers a sequence of spatial regions at each time slot. Note that nearby time slots may have similar spatial region distribution. Thus, given check-in datasets, we use the idea of data compression to obtain a sequence of representative segments, where each representative segment captures spatial region distribution at the corresponding time interval. To measure the quality of a segmentation result, we propose a representation cost function based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. In addition, because deriving the sequence of segments incurs expensive computational cost, we propose a family of greedy algorithms for segmentation to serve diverse requirements: efficient compression, informative compression, and cost-effective compression. Besides, to handle the massive amount of incoming check-in data, we also propose an incremental compression approach to incrementally update the mobility evolution. We conduct experiments on Foursquare datasets to demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

AB  - In the present epoch of technology medical field has become one of the favorite topics of researcher and cancer is among one of them. It is a topic of concern because actual treatment of this disease is not found till date. Patients having this disease can only be saved if and only if it is found in early stage (stage I and stage II). If it is detected in latter stage (stage III and stage IV) then chance of survival will be very less. Machine learning and data mining technique will help medical field to tackle with this problem. Cancer has various symptoms such as tumor, abnormal bleeding, more weight loss etc. It is not necessary that all kinds of tumors are cancerous. Tumors are basically of two types i.e. benign or malignant. To provide appropriate treatment to the patients, symptoms must be studied properly and an automatic prediction system is required which will classify the tumor into benign or malignant. In today's internet world, bulk of data is generated on social media or healthcare websites. From this huge amount of data, symptoms can be fetched by using data mining technique, which will be further useful for cancer detection or classification. This paper makes survey of such latest research study that makes use of online and offline data for cancer classification.

AB  - Social media has become a popular platform that connects people who share information, in particular personal opinions. Through such a fast information exchange mechanism, reputation of individuals, consumer products, or business companies can be quickly built up within a social network. Recently, applications mining social network data start emerging to find the communities sharing the same interests for marketing purposes. Knowing the reputation of social network entities, such as celebrities or business companies, can help develop better strategies for election campaigns or new product advertisements. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model to collectively measure reputations of entities in social networks. By collecting and analyzing large amount of user activities on Facebook, our model can effectively and efficiently rank entities, such as presidential candidates, professional sport teams, musician bands, and companies, based on their social reputation. The proposed model produces results largely consistent with the two publicly available systems - movie ranking in Internet Movie Database and business school ranking by the US news &amp; World Report - with the correlation coefficients of 0.75 and -0.71, respectively.

AB  - Nowadays, the analysis of social networks, as well as the community evolution has become a hotly discussed topic in social computing field. In this paper, we focus on mining and tracking the dynamic communities based on social networking analysis. Based on a generic framework for the dynamic community discovery, a computational approach is developed to extract users' static and dynamic features for the temporal trend detection. A dynamically socialized user networking model is then presented to describe users' various social relationships. A mechanism is proposed and developed to detect the dynamic user communities, and track their evolving changes. Experiments using Twitter data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in tracking how communities dynamically create, split, and merge from a group of connected people in social media environments.

AB  - Social media including Twitter create a space for expression and dissemination of thoughts and opinions on various topics and various events and they have created opportunity to apply theories and technology leading to search and explore the trends. Mining stream data needs to be balanced in three different branches: accuracy, time and memory. The optimal accuracy rate has obtained in the stream data using stochastic gradient descent algorithm. In this paper, we show that replacing the stochastic gradient descent algorithm in tree leaves causes improvement and reliability of the forecast. The proposed algorithm, Hoeffding stochastic gradient descent, has not changed the time while increasing the accuracy. Studies on the tweets that have been randomly selected shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms when assessing the sentiment stream data.

AB  - Quick and accurate decision-making has currently been a modern governmental characteristic, since the development of information and communication technologies also grow very rapidly. One way to support the quick and accurate decision-making is predicting the trending topic. The research aimed at assisting the government of Makassar City to predict the trending topic which would happen by analyzing the historical stack in the data mining. The method used was K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), in which prediction on the trending topic was determined based on the membership distance of a class. The research was conducted based on the news and conversation taken from the online and social media related to Makassar City Government with 393.667 raw data, in which the preprocessing was then carried out to determine the trending and non-trending conversations, producing 2007 trained and tested data. The system performance analysis technique applied was confusion matrix with calculation of percentages of the accuracy, precision, and recall. The result showed that using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the accuracy of 81,13% is obtained.

AB  - Sentiment analysis/classification is a widely studied problem of natural language processing and data mining. With the availability of social media, there are a lot of data but it's hard to find a labeled training set because of its high cost. The goal of active learning is to get a better or same performance with fewer training data. In this work, the feasibility of active learning scheme for Turkish sentiment analysis is investigated. As a result, the same performance with full training set could be obtained with only half of the training set selected by active learning. Moreover, the affects of different clustering algorithms used at the initial set selection are investigated.

AB  - In this paper, we study the problem of performing multi-label classification on networked data, where each instance in the network is assigned with multiple labels and the connections between instances are driven by various casual reasons. Networked data extracted from social media or web pages may not reflect the relationship between users in real life accurately. By mining the links that actually exist but have not yet been found in the network, the potential relations between users can be discovered, and thus help us to predict the users' labels more accurately. In this work, we propose a link prediction-based multi-label relational neighbor classifier which employs social context features (LP-SCRN). It firstly predicts missing links in the network, and then calculates the weights of the links according to the similarity between nodes in their social features. In addition, by capturing the potential correlation between nodes, we expand a node's neighbor set, and refine the multi-label relational classifier. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of multi-label classification on networked data.

AB  - The rapid growth of online social media acts as a medium where people contribute their opinion and emotions as text messages. The messages include reviews and opinions on certain topics such as movie, book, product, politics and so on. Opinion mining refers to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text mining to identify or classify whether the opinion expressed in text message is positive or negative. Back Propagation Neural Networks is supervised machine learning methods that analyze data and recognize the patterns that are used for classification. This work focuses on binary classification to classify the text sentiment into positive and negative reviews. In this study Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the principal components, to be used as predictors and back propagation neural network (BPN) have been employed as a classifier. The performance of PCA+ BPN and BPN without PCA has been compared using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. The classifier is validated using 10-Fold cross validation. The result shows the effectiveness of BPN with PCA used as a feature reduction method for text sentiment classification.

AB  - Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) is one of the government institution with the duty to provide accurate and reliable data for the government and society uses. Currently BPS does not have basic tool that can be used to evaluate usage of their data by people or government. The aim of this study is to analyze the usage of BPS data, especially in economics by people or society via social media "Twitter", mapping them and comparing the result with the availability of the current data in BPS so that some suggestions for upgrading and advancing BPS in providing data to the public can be made. Some comments, especially about economics, from the public via Twitter were mined and classified by Decision tree method. Four categories data were produced: (1) Not in the field of economic, (2) in the field but not using BPS data, (3) in the field that may be using BPS data and (4) in the field that using BPS data. Tweets harvesting were done during two months period January 2016 til February 2016 by using Twitter Archiver. About 77.854 tweets that indicates to economic topic were collected. 2.360 data were used for training data. The result showed that 49.425 tweets were classified as economic topic. The majority of class was obtained from the tweets of economics but not using BPS data. 12 major keywords were obtained during this study. These keywords were generated using unigram, bigram, and trigram. In conclusion, we found that 3 primary keywords about economics were needed to be concerned by BPS: The economic policy package, Palm Oil, and Creative Economy.

AB  - For the past seven decades the term Big Data is known, but due to the emerging technology shift of this era, it is captivating a lot of attention from the researchers of mathematics, computing, telecommunication, information technology, data warehousing, and mining. As this generation is living in the age of technology where data is playing a vital role and especially the Big Data has lots of success stories, but at the same time it is becoming the biggest threat to network service provider, telecom industry, and homeland security. Every device such as smart phones, laptop, desktop, etc. connected with the network is contributing to add data to a Big Data pool by using different applications. Social media such as Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Apple, Google, Google+, Twitter, Flickr, etc. are few famous tools which are used to add redundant data. The question appears, is it mandatory to store and especially process all the data either useful or redundant? This research paper is focusing for filtering useful data from redundant data by using their parameters which are velocity, variety, and volume. In proposed architecture, Memcache DB (for velocity), Voldemort layers (for variety) and MapReduce (for volume) are linked with Hadoop to achieve filtered data. Kalman filter recursive approach is used to inject the data back into Hadoop Distributed File System to reduce processing cost of next iterations.

AB  - Traditional CRM (Customer Relationship Management) contains 3 modules, Marketing, Sales, and Support, which rely on the customer relationship and profiling information. While the information contained in those 3 modules is input by operator, it will be prudent to gather much more information from the Internet. We can find relationship between customers and find their profile from the Internet. This information can be used to enrich and direct the CRM to perform better in supporting the business objectives. Gathering information from the Internet means that we need Information Retrieval and Information Extraction that involve many sources from Internet, such as social media, net blog, and news. This research provides the model of data mining utilization in traditional CRM to become social CRM. This research contributes for CRM enhancement where customer centric application becomes automated.

AB  - Lately, a large amount of traffic-related data, such as traffic statistics, accident statistics, road information, and drivers' and pedestrians' comments, has been collected through sensors and social media networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for mining traffic risk from such heterogeneous data. Traffic risk refers to the possibility of traffic accidents occurring. We specifically focus on two issues: 1) predicting the number of accidents for any road and intersection and 2) clustering roads to identify the risk factors that are common to risky road clusters. We followed a unifying approach to these issues by using feature-based non-negative matrix factorization (FNMF). More specifically, we developed a new multiplicative updating FNMF algorithm capable of processing large traffic data. Using real traffic data from Tokyo, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is able to predict traffic risk at any location more accurately and efficiently than existing methods. A number of clusters containing high-risk roads were identified and their risk factors were characterized. Through this study we have opened a new research area of traffic risk mining.

AB  - Today, we live in a `data age'. Due to rapid increase in the amount of user-generated data on social media platforms like Twitter, several opportunities and new open doors have been prompted for organizations that endeavour hard to keep a track on customer reviews and opinions about their products. Twitter is a huge fast emergent micro-blogging social networking platform for users to express their views about politics, products sports etc. These views are useful for businesses, government and individuals. Hence, tweets can be used as a valuable source for mining public's opinion. Sentiment analysis is a process of automatically identifying whether a user-generated text expresses positive, negative or neutral opinion about an entity (i.e. product, people, topic, event etc). The objective of this paper is to give step-by-step detail about the process of sentiment analysis on twitter data using machine learning. This paper also provides details of proposed approach for sentiment analysis. This work proposes a Text analysis framework for twitter data using Apache spark and hence is more flexible, fast and scalable. Naïve Bayes and Decision trees machine learning algorithms are used for sentiment analysis in the proposed framework.

AB  - We have implemented a social media data mining system capable of forecasting events related to Latin American social unrest. Our method directly extracts a small number of tweets from publicly-available data on twitter.com, condenses similar tweets into coherent forecasts, and assembles a detailed and easily-interpretable audit trail which allows end users to quickly collect information about an upcoming event. Our system functions by continually applying multiple textual and geographic filters to a large volume of data streaming from twitter.com via the public API as well as a commercial data feed. To be specific, we search the entirety of twitter.com for a few carefully chosen keywords, search within those tweets for mentions of future dates, filter again using various logistic regression classifiers, and finally assign a location to an event by geocoding retweeters. Geocoding is done using our previously-developed in-house geocoding service which, at the time of this writing, can infer the home location for over 62M twitter.com users [1]. Additionally, we identify demographics likely interested in an upcoming event by searching retweeter's recent posts for demographic-specific keywords.

AB  - Today's world completely depends on computer technology's advancement to get the best of whatever they want or choose. Because of internet, sharing and exchanging information is really easiest task than ever before. And same technology is providing us ample amount of data, information while selecting best of services, best of products available as well as best of individual based on quality features. Even due to various media of social information input like blogs, forums, communities, twits, etc. it is far superior to give feedback on any organization, services provided, product qualities, individual skills very easily and rapidly. Additionally like individual internet user, all kind of organization experts, management teams, analysts are focusing on such data and its analysis for their business growths and trends. In the same direction, this research paper focuses on development of automated opinion mining system to help, analyze, evaluate user's reviews, and to provide on click solution of reviews mined for business decision making process. This paper explores an idea of extracting real time dataset through provided Graphical User Interface (GUI). On this extracted dataset, Part of Speech tagging is applied to get implicit as well as explicit features of the product. Then the orientation of opinions is identified. After this, the reviews are classified according to their orientation. The summarization unit would then generate opinion mining result in visualized form for further decision making process. In this system, dictionary based and corpus based approaches are combined together. Also it provides more accuracy in obtained results to make this system trustworthy and efficient.

AB  - At the present, we are in the midst of another major societal shift that is leading to a hyper-connected society. In this hyper-connected society, the convergence of mobile technology, online access and global media is connecting masses of people without precedents, with resulting impacts on communication, content creation and social engagement. Online presence and interactive mobile services are, therefore, become a key strategy for entities that seek to increase user engagement and awareness. In this paper, we introduce an interoperable framework for the visualisation and processing of 3D city models on mobile devices. Our solution crystallises on City GML's ability to store and describe 3D city-related geometry along with its semantics, which is fundamental to city level operations like validity checking, automatic integration, thematic queries, and spatial data mining. The streaming of 3D models is transparent to the user, who perceives remote models as locally stored. The user interface is designed for 3D data exploration and analysis on mobile environments, and it is fully compliant with OGC open web standards.

AB  - It has become an era where everything is on the web with ever more chances of data utilization on the web. Still, there are obstacles to make the use of the web efficiently. With too much information, Internet users have often come across information that are not relevant for their use. On top of that, until recently, most of web content have not contained semantic information, posing difficulties for mechanical analysis. The Semantic Web emerged as a way to tackle those poor qualities of the web. Adopting formal languages such as RDF or OWL, the semantic web has made the Internet become more highly available for computer-based analysis. In this study, what we aimed at is building a small business knowledge base to provide useful information for small business owners for their marketing strategies or dynamic QA systems for their restaurant recommendation services. The knowledge base was built according to the concept of the Semantic Web. To build the knowledge base, first, it is needed to conduct web crawling from different web sources including social media. However, the crawled data typically come in informal and do not have any semantic information. So we devised text mining techniques to catch useful information from them and generate formal knowledge for the knowledge base.

AB  - Social-media websites, such as newspapers, blogs, and forums, are the main places of generation and exchange of user-generated comments. These comments are viable sources for opinion mining, descriptive annotations and information extraction. User-generated comments are formatted using a HTML template, they are therefore entwined with the other information in the HTML document. Their unsupervised extraction is thus a taxing issue - even greater when considering the extraction of nested answers by different users. This paper presents a novel technique (CommentsMiner) for unsupervised users comments extraction. Our approach uses both the theoretical framework of frequent subtree mining and data extraction techniques. We demonstrate that the comment mining task can be modelled as a constrained closed induced subtree mining problem followed by a learning-to-rank problem. Our experimental evaluations show that CommentsMiner solves the plain comments and nested comments extraction problems for 84% of a representative and accessible dataset, while outperforming existing baselines techniques.

AB  - A strong brand is a major asset to any corporation. Traditional brand image and reputation tracking is limited to news wires and contact centers analysis. However, with the emergence of Web, consumer generated media (CGM), such as blogs, news forums, message boards, and web pages/sites, is rapidly transforming the way companies analyze their brand perceptions. This paper describes the next generation COBRA (Corporate Brand and Reputation Analysis) approach to mining a wide range of CGM content to discover how the social media-based community perceives the brand. The solution processes a diverse set of structured and unstructured information and mines CGM content by generating multiple taxonomies from the data. These taxonomies are then used singly and in combination to better understand important brand characteristics and hence enhance marketing and strategic decision making. We illustrate our approach with a real-world case study involving the Kraft Foodspsila Vegemite brand.

AB  - With the usage of Web 2.0 technologies, the internet users share their views via social media resulting in a large amount of raw data for which data mining techniques are needed to extract valuable knowledge. An example of people's views that can be extracted from the users' comments(tweets) is their interest or preference on different products, services, events etc. This research work aims to study on the customer intention to purchase in social-commerce(s-commerce). Finding out the intention of customer to purchase in s-commerce is important due to the major role being brought by the customers in marketing. Sentiment analysis is seen to be the most appropriate method to extract customer's opinions. This paper presents the fundamental part of the research for developing a hybrid sentiment analysis model by using machine learning approach and lexicon-based approach to analyze communications especially using Malay language on social network portals to determine the customer intention to purchase in s-commerce. Precision, recall, accuracy and f-measure metrics are proposed for the computing and comparing the results of the experiments.

AB  - Understanding users' sentiments in social media is important in many domains, such as marketing and online applications. Is one demographic group inherently different from another? Does a group express the same sentiment both in private and public? How can we compare the sentiments of different groups composed of multiple attributes? In this paper, we take an interdisciplinary approach towards mining the patterns of textual sentiments and metadata. First, we look into several existing hypotheses in social science on the interplay between user characteristics and sentiments, as well as the related evidence in the field of social network data analysis. Second, we present a dataset with unique features (Facebook users' chats and posts in multiple languages) and a procedure to process the data. Third, we test our hypotheses on this dataset and interpret the results. Fourth, under the subgroup-discovery paradigm, we present an approach with two algorithms that generalizes single-attribute testing. This approach provides more detailed insight into the relationships among attributes, and reveals interesting attribute-value combinations with distinct sentiments. Furthermore, it offers novel hypotheses for examination in future studies.

AB  - Online social and news media generate rich and timely information about real-world events of all kinds. However, the huge amount of data available, along with the breadth of the user base, requires a substantial effort of information filtering to successfully drill down to relevant topics and events. Trending topic detection is therefore a fundamental building block to monitor and summarize information originating from social sources. There are a wide variety of methods and variables and they greatly affect the quality of results. We compare six topic detection methods on three Twitter datasets related to major events, which differ in their time scale and topic churn rate. We observe how the nature of the event considered, the volume of activity over time, the sampling procedure and the pre-processing of the data all greatly affect the quality of detected topics, which also depends on the type of detection method used. We find that standard natural language processing techniques can perform well for social streams on very focused topics, but novel techniques designed to mine the temporal distribution of concepts are needed to handle more heterogeneous streams containing multiple stories evolving in parallel. One of the novel topic detection methods we propose, based on -grams cooccurrence and topic ranking, consistently achieves the best performance across all these conditions, thus being more reliable than other state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - The Social Media (SM) is affecting clients' preferences by modeling their thoughts, attitudes, opinions, views and public mood. Observing the SM activities is a decent approach to measure clients' loyalty, keeping a track on their opinion towards products preferences or social event. Opinion Mining (OM) is the most rising research field of text mining using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Several algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy (ME), were utilized to extract information that differentiates the user's opinion whether it's positive, negative or neutral. User's opinions and reviews are very beneficial information for individuals, businesses, and governments. In this paper, we compare the intelligent algorithms, which are utilized for OM in SM data over the last five years. The results show that using SVM with Part Of Speech (POS) or POS, Unigram and Bigram with J48 accomplish Sentiment Classification (SC) accuracy 92%.

AB  - With the rapid development of social networks, more and more users choose to share their own photos with their friends. Especially, users prefer to share the photos they took during traveling, thus there emerges many user generated content for place-of-interests (POIs). So based on the user contributed photos, we can summarize each POI by mining location-of-interest (LOI, which represents the attractive viewpoints of POI) and selecting some representative images from them. It is important for scheduling a traveling, and in this paper, an effective POI summarization approach is proposed by an improved geo-clustering with visual and views verification, which helps us to have a representative and comprehensive perception for POI. In our approach, we firstly collect POI related photos from social media, and filter the raw data by the combination of tags and geo-locations. Secondly, we mine LOIs for each POI by the improved geo-location clustering method. Finally, we employ visual and views verification to select images from LOIs to summarize the POI. We conduct a series of experiments based on Flcoickr dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB  - In recent years, text mining and sentiment analysis have received great attention due to the abundance of opinion data that exist in social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. Sentiments are projected on these media using texts for expressing feelings such as friendship, social support, anger, happiness, etc. Existing sentiment analysis studies tend to identify user behaviors and state of minds but remain insufficient due to complexities in conveyed texts. In this research paper, we focus on the usage of text mining for sentiment classification. Illustration is performed on Tunisian users' statuses on Facebook posts during the &amp;#x201C;Arabic Spring&amp;#x201D; era. Our aim is to extract useful information, about users' sentiments and behaviors during this sensitive and significant period. For that purpose, we propose a method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Nai&amp;#x0308;ve Bayes. We also construct a sentiment lexicon, based on the emoticons, interjections and acronyms', from extracted statuses updates. Moreover, we perform some comparative experiments between two machine learning algorithms SVM and Nai&amp;#x0308;ve Bayes through a training model for sentiment classification.

AB  - In a new era of Big Data, the rapid growth of the applications, such as social media and web-search, requires efficient and scalable machine learning and statistical analytical algorithms. However, there lacks easy-to-use and efficient software frameworks or systems that can support fast development of such big data analytical algorithms. To solve these problems, we propose Octopus, an easy-to-use and efficient analytical system for big data. Octopus allows data analysts conduct complex data analytics for big data with traditional programming languages and methods in an easy and efficient way. To achieve the goal of ease-to-use, we propose a matrix-based unified programming model, which is the core of many data-intensive statistical applications such as numerical analysis and data mining. Further, in order to improve the performance, the Octopus software framework adopts various distributed computing platforms, including Hadoop MapReduce, Spark and MPI. On these computing platforms, we design several parallel matrix computation algorithms, which are suitable for various scenarios. Finally, the features of Octopus are encapsulated into a library with matrix-based APIs and exposed to users as an R package. R is a widely-used statistical programming language and supports diversified data analysis tasks through extension packages. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves efficient performance and near linear scalability.

AB  - Sentiment analysis of tweets is a popular method of opinion mining social media. Many machine learning techniques exist that can improve the performance of classifiers trained to determine the sentiment or emotional polarity of a tweet, however, they are designed with different objectives and it is unclear which techniques are most beneficial. Additionally, these techniques may behave differently depending on quality of data issues, such as class imbalance, a common problem when using real world data. In an effort to determine which techniques are more important, we tested 12 techniques consisting of: eight feature selection techniques, bagging, boosting and data sampling with two post sampling class ratios. Using five base learners, we compare these techniques against each other and each base learners with no additional technique. We train and test each classifier on a balanced dataset and two imbalanced datasets with different class ratios. Additionally, we conduct statistical tests to determine if the differences observed between techniques are significant. Our results show that bagging and seven of the eight feature selection techniques significantly improve performance (compared to using no technique) on all three datasets, while boosting and data sampling are less beneficial for imbalanced tweet sentiment data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing these three types of techniques on tweet sentiment data and the first to show that feature selection and ensemble techniques perform better than data sampling on tweet sentiment data.

AB  - The potential to extract actionable insights from Big Data has gained increased attention of researchers in academia as well as several industrial sectors. The field has become interesting and problems look even more exciting to solve ever since organizations have been trying to tame large volumes of complex and fast arriving Big Data streams through newer computing paradigms. However, extracting meaningful and actionable information from Big Data is a challenging and daunting task. The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists. Deriving information from Big Data is also subject to challenges associated with data security and privacy. These and other challenges are discussed in context of the selected problems to illustrate the potential of Big Data analytics.

AB  - As businesses seek to monetize their data, they are leveraging Web-based delivery mechanisms to provide publically available data sources. Also, as analytics becomes a central part of many business functions such as customer segmentation, competitive intelligence and fraud detection, many businesses are seeking to enrich their internal data records with data from these data sources. As the number of sources with varying degrees of accuracy and quality proliferate, it is a non-trivial task to effectively select which sources to use for a particular enrichment task. The old model of statically buying data from one or two providers becomes inefficient because of the rapid growth of new forms of useful data such as social media and the lack of dynamism to plug sources in and out. In this paper, we present the data enrichment framework, a tool that uses data mining and other semantic techniques to automatically guide the selection of sources. The enrichment framework also monitors the quality of the data sources and automatically penalizes sources that continue to return low quality results.

AB  - Actionability is a mode of revealing actionable knowledge in the form of Action Rules from large datasets. Action rule imparts in the form of recommendations as how a data object can change from one value to another more desirable value. The towering production of data in the recent years, due to increased usage of web, social media and IoT, has led to the age of big data. Also, abundant usage of cloud storages and cloud based services causes the data to be spread around the globe. This requires more time and space for a single computer to cope with such widespread data. Ecosystems like Hadoop MapReduce, Spark have been introduced to store, process and retrieve back the data efficiently in a distributed fashion. Data mining finds substantial improvements over such distributed frameworks to process huge volume of data and acquire knowledge from them in a short span of time. In this paper, we present an approach SARGS: Specific Action Rule discovery based on Grabbing Strategy, to build more specific Action Rules using Apache Spark framework and evaluate the results with our previous Hadoop MapReduce system (MR-Random Forest Algorithm for Distributed Action Rules Discovery). Also, we propose a novel approach to distribute data in a distributed environment to get more optimal Action Rules and upgraded ARoGS algorithm to get more specific Action Rules.

AB  - Mining is used to help people to extract valuable information from large amount of data. Sentiment analysis focuses on the analysis and understanding of the emotions from the text patterns. It identifies the opinion or attitude that a person has towards a topic or an object and it seeks to identify the viewpoint underlying a text span. Sentiment analysis is useful in social media monitoring to automatically characterize the overall feeling or mood of consumers as reflected in social media toward a specific brand or company and determine whether they are viewed positively or negatively on the web. This new form of analysis has been widely adopted in customer relation management especially in the context of complaint management. For automating the task of classifying a single topic textual review, document-level sentiment classification is used for expressing a positive or negative sentiment. So analyzing sentiment using Multi-theme document is very difficult and the accuracy in the classification is less. The document level classification approximately classifies the sentiment using Bag of words in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. In proposed work, a new algorithm called Sentiment Fuzzy Classification algorithm with parts of speech tags is used to improve the classification accuracy on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews dataset.

AB  - Mobile networks enable users to post on social media services (e.g., Twitter) from anywhere and anytime. This new phenomenon led to the emergence of a new line of work of mining the behavior of mobile users taking into account the spatio-temporal aspects of their engagement with online social media. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending the right locations to users at the right time. We claim to propose the first comprehensive model, called STT (Spatio-Temporal Topic), to capture the spatio-temporal aspects of user check-ins in a single probabilistic model for location recommendation. Our proposed generative model does not only captures spatio-temporal aspects of check-ins, but also profiles users. We conduct experiments on real life data sets from Twitter, Go Walla, and Bright kite. We evaluate the effectiveness of STT by evaluating the accuracy of location recommendation. The experimental results show that STT achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the areas of recommender systems as well as topic modeling.

AB  - The need for designing Arabic text mining systems for the use on social media posts is increasingly becoming a significant and attractive research area. It serves and enhances the knowledge needed in various domains. The main focus of this paper is to propose a novel framework combining sentiment analysis with subjective analysis on Arabic social media posts to determine whether people are interested or not interested in a defined subject. For those purposes, text classification methods- including preprocessing and machine learning mechanisms-are applied. Essentially, the performance of the framework is tested using Twitter as a data source, where possible volunteers on a certain subject are identified based on their posted tweets along with their subject-related information. Twitter is considered because of its popularity and its rich content from online microblogging services. The results obtained are very promising with an accuracy of 89 %, thereby encouraging further research.

AB  - Consumers often have difficulties expressing and understanding medical terminologies due to gaps in their domain knowledge and those of the health care professionals. This language gap is a barrier to effective health information seeking, and ultimately, informed decision making. However, despite the recent research on mismatches between consumer and professional languages, there have been limited studies tackles on how to effectively discover consumer health-related expressions through mining of social media data. In this research, we propose an automatic key-phrase extraction approach to identify consumer health expressions with regard to adverse drug reaction (ADRs) in social media. These identified expressions can help to extend current Consumer Health Vocabularies (CHV) and to enhance the performance of ADRs signal detection for pharmacovigilance systems. The proposed method can be applied to other problem domains that require automatic key-phrase extraction when there is a mismatch between the languages used by the layperson and the professionals.

AB  - Among the numerous challenges faced by enterprises today, two recent trends have significantly impacted the manner businesses are run and decisions are made. First, many enterprises have adopted Business Architecture concepts to structure, define, plan, measure and optimize their operations. Second, enterprises have leveraged the vast wealth of dynamic and unstructured web information to identify competitive advantages, recognize social media sentiment patterns or anomalies, and assuage potentially damaging client perceptions. These tasks are commonly performed independently of each other, thus missing several synergetic opportunities. By establishing a systematic relationship between these seemingly disjoint trends, enterprises and consulting service companies gain competitive, operational advantages, and recurring benefits. This paper describes a systematic approach whereby results from text mining analysis are integrated with the Business Architecture to empower business users to leverage social media data for increased decision making efficiencies. Applying design science, the proposed approach is explained by providing a conceptual model and a two-phased integration method. It is then buttressed by a sample scenario derived from the banking industry. We discuss the potential operational and competitive gains realized by adopting our approach, and the directions for future work.

AB  - Social network analysis has been one of the research focuses with the developing of social media services. Social influence also attracts ever-increasing attention and interests from both the sociology and the data mining scholars, but the research of influence is mainly limited in the user level, the community level influence is rarely involved. In this paper, we develop a novel model to analyze and evaluate the community level influence and help the decision maker to comprehend the disparity in influence of different communities. This paper also proposes a simple heuristic node-selection strategy considering the community influence to spread influence, and the experiments of the spread of influence through the social network datasets prove the rationality of the proposed community influence analysis model.

AB  - Twitter is a social media platform is a great place where people from all parts of the world can make their opinions heard. Twitter produces around 500 million of tweets daily which amounts to about 8TB of data. The data generated in twitter can be very useful if analyzed as we can extract important information via opinion mining. Opinions about any news or launch of a product or a certain kind of trend can be observed well in twitter data. The main aim of sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is to discover emotion, opinion, subjectivity and attitude from a natural text. In twitter sentiment analysis, we categorize tweets into positive and negative sentiment. Clustering is a protean procedure in which identically resembled objects are grouped together and form a pack or cluster. We conducted a study and found out that the use of clustering can quickly and efficiently distinguish tweets on the basis of their sentiment scores and can find weekly and strongly positive or negative tweets when clustered with results of different dictionaries. This paper surveys different approaches of clustering with respect to sentiment analysis and presents a way to find relationships between the tweets on the basis of polarity and subjectivity.

AB  - The concept of novel authors occurring in streaming data source, such as evolving social media, is an unaddressed problem up until now. Existing author attribution techniques deals with the datasets, where the total number of authors do not change in the training or the testing time of the classifiers. This study focuses on the question, “what happens if new authors are added into the system by time?”. Moreover in this study we are also dealing with the problems that some of the authors may not stay and may disappear by time or may reappear after a while. In this study stream mining approaches are proposed to solve the problem. The test scenarios are created over the existing IMDB62 data set, which is widely used by author attribution algorithms already. We used our own shuffling algorithms to create the effect of novel authors. Also before the stream mining, POS tagging approaches and the TF-IDF methods are applied for the feature extraction. And we have applied bi-tag approach where two consecutive tags are considered as a new feature in our approach. By the help of novel techniques, first time proposed in this paper, the success rate has been increased from 35% to 61% for the authorship attribution on streaming text data.

AB  - Stock market index as the composite of a series of representative stocks plays a very crucial role in the financial market. Predicting the change of stock market index is vital for investors and stock holders to capture the trend of stocks which they are interested. Recently research from behavioral finance suggests that emotions of market participates can influence stock market index. However, variable selection becomes a major challenge. Normally, lots of key words related to emotions can be extracted from the social media, meaning that the number of predictor variables p for the data mining methods is very large. Traditional variable selection methods require that the number of observations n is sufficient lager and regularization methods could select variables for high dimensional conditions. However, it is common that n is close to p when analyzing the emotions data within a specific time period. Under this condition, both variable selection methods are applicable, but few research has been done on it. In this paper, we compare the traditional variable selection method with the regularization method under the condition that n is close to p. Then we apply typical data mining methods to predict the SSE Composite Index in China with the selected variables. The results show that the regularization methods give much better performance compared with traditional variable infliction factor (VIF) analysis.

AB  - Social media posts are often tagged with geographical coordinates or other information that allows identifying user positions, this way enabling mobility pattern analysis using trajectory mining techniques. This paper presents a methodology and discusses results of a study aimed at discovering behavior and mobility patterns of Instagram users who visited EXPO 2015, the Universal Exposition hosted in Milan, Italy, from May to October 2015. We collected and analyzed geotagged posts published by about 238,000 Instagram users who visited EXPO 2015, including more than 570,000 posts published during the visits, and 2.63 million posts published by them from one month before to one month after their visit to EXPO. To cope with this large amount of data, the whole process - from data collection to data mining - was implemented on a high-performance cloud platform that provided the necessary storage and compute resources. The analysis allowed us to discover how the number of visitors changed over time, which were the sets of most frequently visited pavilions, which countries the visitors came from, and the main flows of destination of visitors towards Italian cities and regions in the days after their visit to EXPO. A strong correlation (Pearson coefficient 0.7) was measured between official visitor numbers and the visit trends produced by our analysis, which assessed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and confirmed the reliability of results.

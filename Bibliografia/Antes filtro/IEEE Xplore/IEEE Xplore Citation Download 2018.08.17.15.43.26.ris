AB  - Documents written in natural language constitute a major part of the artefacts produced during the software engineering life cycle. Studies indicate that more than 80% of enterprise data is stored in some sort of unstructured form, mainly as text. Therefore, the growth of user-generated content, especially from social media, provides a huge amount of data which allows discovering the experiences, opinions, and feelings of users. Text mining refers to the set of tools, techniques, and algorithms adopted to extract useful information from unstructured data. Considering that Portuguese ranks among the ten most spoken languages, and it is the second most common in Twitter, this study aims to map current primary studies that relate to the application of text mining for Portuguese. A systematic mapping method was applied and 6075 primary studies were retrieved up to the year 2014. A total of 203 studies were included, from which more than 60% analyse texts written in Brazilian variant. The majority of studies focus on the text classification task. Support vector machine and Naïve Bayes appear as main the algorithms. Folha de São Paulo and Público newspapers appear as main corpora, followed by the Portuguese Attorney General's Office corpus and Twitter.

AB  - User-generated content on online social media (OSM) has several data mining applications, such as extracting useful information during disaster events. Since popular / important content is often re-posted by multiple people on OSM, identifying duplicate content is an important first step in many data mining applications. In this work, we develop a methodology to identify near-duplicate images posted on Twitter. The principal challenge in this task is to efficiently handle a continuous incoming stream of thousands of images, for which prior duplication detection methods are unsuitable. Experiments on real Twitter data collected during two recent disaster events demonstrate that the proposed methodology identifies duplicate images accurately as well as rapidly.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to develop a community discovery scheme in a multi-dimensional network for data mining applications. In online social media, networked data consists of multiple dimensions/entities such as users, tags, photos, comments, and stories. We are interested in finding a group of users who interact significantly on these media entities. In a co-citation network, we are interested in finding a group of authors who relate to other authors significantly on publication information in titles, abstracts, and keywords as multiple dimensions/entities in the network. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a framework (MultiComm)to identify a seed-based community in a multi-dimensional network by evaluating the affinity between two items in the same type of entity (same dimension)or different types of entities (different dimensions)from the network. Our idea is to calculate the probabilities of visiting each item in each dimension, and compare their values to generate communities from a set of seed items. In order to evaluate a high quality of generated communities by the proposed algorithm, we develop and study a local modularity measure of a community in a multi-dimensional network. Experiments based on synthetic and real-world data sets suggest that the proposed framework is able to find a community effectively. Experimental results have also shown that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better in accuracy than the other testing algorithms in finding communities in multi-dimensional networks.

AB  - Social patterns and graphical representation of geospatial activity is important for describing a person's typical behavior. We discuss a framework using social media and GPS smart phone to track an individual and establish normal activity with a network biometric. An individual's daily routine may include visiting many locations - home, work, shopping, entertainment and other destinations. All of these activities pose a routine or status quo of expected behavior. What has always been difficult, however, is predicting a change to the status quo, or predicting unusual behavior. We propose taking the knowledge of location information over a relatively long period of time and marrying that with modern analytical capabilities. The result is a biometric that can be fused and correlated with another's behavioral biometric to determine relationships. Our solution is based on the analytical environment to support the ingestion of many data sources and the integration of analytical algorithms such as feature extraction, crowd source analysis, open source data mining, trends, pattern analysis and linear game theory optimization. Our framework consists of a hierarchy of data, space, time, and knowledge entities. We exploit such statistics to predict behavior or activity based on past observations. We use multivariate mutual information as a measure to compare behavioral biometrics.

AB  - Social media has enabled a new breed of soft sensors that enriches the IoT paradigm with new forms of data. The present work introduces a novel approach for personal mobility mining that combines these new data-sources with built-in sensors of a smart-phone in order to timely extract personal mobility pattens by means of the Complex Event Processing (CEP) approach. Unlike previous solutions, the present work profits from both the textual and location data of social-network sites by also dealing with the actual scarcity of geo-tagged documents in those sites. Finally, a preliminary study of the feasibility of our proposal is stated.

AB  - Current growth of individuals on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires continuous support and care. With the popularity of social media, online communities of people affected by ASD emerge. This paper presents an analysis of these online communities through understanding aspects that differentiate such communities. In this paper, the aspects given are not expressed in terms of friendship, exchange of information, social support or recreation, but rather with regard to the topics and linguistic styles that people express in their on-line writing. Using data collected unobtrusively from LiveJournal, we analyze posts made by ten autism communities in conjunction with those made by a control group of standard communities. Significant differences have been found between autism and control communities when characterized by latent topics of discussion and psycholinguistic features. Latent topics are found to have greater predictive power than linguistic features when classifying blog posts as either autism or control community. This study suggests that data mining of online blogs has the potential to detect clinically meaningful data. It opens the door to possibilities including sentinel risk surveillance and harnessing the power in diverse large datasets.

AB  - Nowadays, most of the business intelligence focus on social media like facebook, twitter, blogs and online commercial websites like shopclues, pepperfry, flipkart, fabfurnish, testfreaks, amazon, greendust etc., to gather comments posted by the buyers in deciding about future demand,brand promotion, market segmentation and product penetration. In turn the buyers were also willing to post their comment about each of the products they buy through online. And these short reviews once refined and analyzed can help us to get a crystal clear opinion about the buyers' view which probably enhances the future buyers to make a buying decision based on spectacular features. This paper includes implementation on data acquisition, preprocessing, combinatory of lexicon and syntactic pattern mining approach (1) to find overall sentiment scores and correlate that score to that of feature score (2) to identify the most promising features of the product.

Our approach is not only specific to user's interests but also involves recommending POIs(Points of Interest) in travel as a sequence from source to destination with few waypoints according to user's interest and affordability. Similar users are mined using LCF (Location based collaborative filtering algorithm) based on their travel history, interests and affordability. The route is recommended based on similarity between user package and route package. Route optimisation is done by similar user's travel records. The hotels and restaurants along the recommended route are highlighted.

AB  - Classification is a technique in data mining for categorizing objects. Text Classification is re-challenged for classifying very short documents or text as shown in social media collection. This paper proposes a method to improve the performance of classification on short documents. In this work, we expand words in every document before the documents are classified We use TFIDF model, Hidden Markov Model k-means clustering, and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for expanding documents. The results show that extending document term by just 1 word will increase its accuracy, while extending by 2,4, and 8 words tend to give stable results.

AB  - Student academic failure prediction is still interesting topics in the Educational Data Mining. One of the challenges is how to predict student academic failure as early as possible. This research focuses on predictive modeling of unsuccessful students in the first year evaluation. We propose a new concept of predictive modeling of the first year evaluation which combines 3 input data: demographics, academic and social media. The modeling can be divided into two sub modeling (normal period and extra period). In this paper, we focus on demographic data modeling (first sub-modeling) which correlated with the probability of a student to pass the first year evaluation on normal period. A Weka tool is used to get a pattern of data by using white box classifier (decision tree and rule base). Meanwhile, to solve the problem of unbalanced in our training data, we use data balancing scenario using same portion oversampling, random oversampling and SMOTE. From the testing result, we choose the best three student failure pattern of the F-Measure minor class value which obtained from “One R” and “ADTree” algorithms using Balancing scenario, the reason is because F-Measure describes the smallest error rate both FP (False Positive) and also FN (False Negative). From the best three of student failure pattern, we found that gender, selection path, study program and age are the attributes that are most correlated with the probability to pass the first year evaluation on extra period.

AB  - Huge amounts of loosely structured and high velocity data are now being generated by ubiquitous mobile sensing devices, aerial sensory systems, cameras and radiofrequency identification readers, which are generating key knowledge into social media behaviors, intelligent transport patterns, military operational environments and space monitoring, safety systems etc. Machine learning models and data mining techniques can be employed to produce actionable intelligence, based on predictive and prescriptive analytics. However, more data is not leading to better predictions as the accuracy of the implicated learning models hugely varies in accordance to the complexity of the given space and related data. Especially in the case of open-ended data streams of massive scale, their efficiency is put to the challenge. In this work, we employ a variety of machine learning methods and apply them to geospatial time-series surveillance data, in an attempt to determine their capacity to learn a vessels behavioral pattern. We evaluate their effectiveness against metrics of accuracy, time and resource usage. The main concept of this study is to determine the most appropriate machine-learning model capable of learning a vessels behavior and performing predictions into a future point in time. Our aim is to document the prediction accuracy of a set of traditional forecasting models and then compare this to the prediction accuracy of streaming algorithms.

AB  - Topological data analysis is a noble method to analyze high-dimensional qualitative data using a set of properties from topology. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of topological data analysis for mining social media data by investigating the problem of image popularity. We randomly crawl images from Instagram, convert their captions to 300 dimensional numerical vectors using Word2vec, calculate cosine distances to evaluate the similarities of the caption vectors, and then apply the distances to a topological data analysis algorithm called mapper.With caption vectors, the results show that topological data analysis is able to cluster the images related to the images' popularity. Moreover, the results show relationships between the clusters that are represented as a monotonic increase of popularity. This approach is compared with traditional clustering algorithms, including k-means and hierarchical clustering, and the results show that topological data analysis outperforms the others.

AB  - At present, digital content has permeated every part of human social life, and has become a valuable resource. However, while the vast amounts of information continue to occur, human beings are persecuted by the loss of information, especially those carrying human culture and civilization. The prolonged preservation technology of digital content faces enormous challenges. Therefore, the managers should consider how to supervise, manage and utilize the digital content for a long time by the scientific and reasonable measures. OAIS provides a conceptual model for the long-term preservation of digital content, it satisfy the basic need of the long-term preservation of digital content from the aspect of system function. But in the practice of preservation, the explicit data model is necessary, moreover, the model should meet the management need of whole life cycle in the long-term preservation of digital content, meanwhile it's necessary to choose the coding formats of media files. In this paper, firstly, we study the digital content management data model and propose a 7-layer reference model of digital content management according to the hierarchical idea. And then using data mining techniques, we implicit in all the associated data layer data extraction, comparison, analysis, and selectively format digital information for maintenance and preservation according to the appropriate standards. Finally, we process the corresponding data resources through data warehouse and online analytical. At the same time, establish the function of the system of internal links and with the external interface, and a series of high-level services on top of these interfaces.

AB  - For decades, the growth and volume of digital data collection has made it challenging to digest large volumes of information and extract underlying structure. Coined `Big Data', massive amounts of information has quite often been gathered inconsistently (e.g from many sources, of various forms, at different rates, etc.). These factors impede the practices of not only processing data, but also analyzing and displaying it in an efficient manner to the user. Many efforts have been completed in the data mining and visual analytics community to create effective ways to further improve analysis and achieve the knowledge desired for better understanding. Our approach for improved big data visual analytics is two-fold, focusing on both visualization and interaction. Given geo-tagged information, we are exploring the benefits of visualizing datasets in the original geospatial domain by utilizing a virtual reality platform. After running proven analytics on the data, we intend to represent the information in a more realistic 3D setting, where analysts can achieve an enhanced situational awareness and rely on familiar perceptions to draw in-depth conclusions on the dataset. In addition, developing a human-computer interface that responds to natural user actions and inputs creates a more intuitive environment. Tasks can be performed to manipulate the dataset and allow users to dive deeper upon request, adhering to desired demands and intentions. Due to the volume and popularity of social media, we developed a 3D tool visualizing Twitter on MIT's campus for analysis. Utilizing emerging technologies of today to create a fully immersive tool that promotes visualization and interaction can help ease the process of understanding and representing big data.

With the growing amount of data being generated by global data sources (e.g., social media and mobile apps) and the popularization of context-specific data (e.g., the Internet of Things), companies and researchers need to connect all these data and extract valuable information. Machine learning has been gaining much attention in data mining, leveraging the birth of new solutions. This paper proposes an architecture to create a flexible and scalable machine learning as a service. An open source solution was implemented and presented. As a case study, a forecast of electricity demand was generated using real-world sensor and weather data by running different algorithms at the same time.

Given an action query and social media data, we mine related pros and cons of the action via extracting significant events as potential outcomes of the action. We propose using actions and characteristics to select relevant messages, and adjective vectors to establish similarity among adjectives. We introduce SS to select event headlines, and to rank them in the final pros-and-cons table. Our results on two data sets indicate our algorithm can generate more meaningful pros and cons than an existing algorithm.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a framework that fuses textual and visual features of user generated social media data to mine the distribution of user interests. The proposed framework consists of three steps: feature extraction, model training, and user interest mining. We choose boards from popular users on Pinterest to collect training and test data. For each pin we extract the term-document matrices as textual features, bag of visual words as low-level visual features, and attributes as mid-level visual features. Representative features are then selected for training topic models using discriminative latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA). In performance evaluation, pins collected from popular users are used to evaluate the classification accuracy and pins collected from other common users are used to evaluate the recommendation performance. Our experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB  - A digital data collection (e.g., scientific publications, enterprise reports, news, and social media) can often be modeled as a heterogeneous information network, linking text with multiple types of entities. Constructing high-quality concept hierarchies that can represent topics at multiple granularities benefits tasks such as search, information browsing, and pattern mining. In this work we present an algorithm for recursively constructing multi-typed topical hierarchies. Contrary to traditional text-based topic modeling, our approach handles both textual phrases and multiple types of entities by a newly designed clustering and ranking algorithm for heterogeneous network data, as well as mining and ranking topical patterns of different types. Our experiments on datasets from two different domains demonstrate that our algorithm yields high quality, multi-typed topical hierarchies.

AB  - Human trafficking is a major concern worldwide which has evolved with the use of the Internet. Illicit web domains and social networks are used to extend this crime online, where hidden advertisements and messages are used to offer illegal services. The heterogeneity and highly dynamic of these domains impose challenges to information extraction, data mining and machine learning techniques which can be used to identify patterns with relevant information regarding human trafficking on the Internet. This paper summarizes the scope of a doctoral program in informatics at a higher education university. The focus of this research program will be to expand studies on this subject through the analysis of data in the Spanish language, based on different sources of information, such as social media, dark web, and online newspapers to identify patterns related to human trafficking.

AB  - The DARPA Network Challenge was a nationwide exercise in the use of social media in extreme events. Teams competed to locate ten red weather balloons that DARPA tethered over public locations across the continental United States for seven to ten hours on Saturday, December 5, 2009. The MIT team won the event, finding all ten locations using monetary incentive and a multi-level marketing payout scheme. This paper outlines the methods used by the 10th place iSchools Caucus team, which used a combination approach of recruiting observers and the use of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to find six of the ten locations. Twitter feeds and publicly available content on competing team websites were captured. Data from these mechanisms were evaluated for content validity using a combination of secondary observers, evaluation of the reputation of reported observers and confirmation of the true identities and locations of reporting individuals by mining additional data from several social networking sites. These methods may have application in law enforcement, homeland security and extreme events when there is a desire to use humans as soft sensors, but where it is impossible to directly recruit observers or motivate them with financial incentives.

We test to see whether models derived from Twitter data can corroborate industry sales figures and we employ text analysis software developed to assess emotional, cognitive, and structural components of text to analyze the twitter dataset to harvest knowledge about consumer sentiment on different wine varietals. A multi-knowledge based approach is proposed using, Self-Organizing Maps and domain expertise in order to establish view the social network conversation. We show that it is possible to both confirm previously known knowledge and find novel information through the proposed methodology.

AB  - Social media sharing Websites allow users to annotate images with free tags, which significantly contribute to the development of the web image retrieval. Tag-based image search is an important method to find images shared by users in social networks. However, how to make the top ranked result relevant and with diversity is challenging. In this paper, we propose a topic diverse ranking approach for tag-based image retrieval with the consideration of promoting the topic coverage performance. First, we construct a tag graph based on the similarity between each tag. Then, the community detection method is conducted to mine the topic community of each tag. After that, inter-community and intra-community ranking are introduced to obtain the final retrieved results. In the inter-community ranking process, an adaptive random walk model is employed to rank the community based on the multi-information of each topic community. Besides, we build an inverted index structure for images to accelerate the searching process. Experimental results on Flickr data set and NUS-Wide data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Sentiment analysis (SA) and opinion mining (OM) becomes a field of interest that fueled the attention of research during the last decade, due to the rise of the amount of internet documents (especially online reviews and comments) on the social media such as blogs and social networks. Many attempts have been conducted to build a corpus for SA, due to the consideration of importance of building such resource as a key factor in SA and OM systems. But the need of building these resources is still ongoing, especially for morphologically-Rich language (MRL) such as Arabic. In this paper, we present MIKA a multi-genre tagged corpus of modern standard Arabic (MSA) and colloquial. MIKA is manually collected and annotated at sentence level with semantic orientation (positive or negative or neutral). A number of rich set of linguistically motivated features (contextual Intensifiers, contextual Shifter and negation handling), syntactic features for conflicting phrases and others are used for the annotation process. Our data focus on MSA and Egyptian dialectal Arabic. We report the efforts of manually building and annotating our sentiment corpus using different types of data, such as tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments).

AB  - Social media mining from Internet has been an emerging research topic. The problem is challenging because of massive data contents from various sources, especially image data from user upload. In recent years, dictionary learning based image classification has been widely studied and gained significant success. In this paper, we propose a framework for automatic detection of interested uniforms in image streams from social networks. The systems is composed of a powerful feature extraction module based on dense SIFT feature and a state-of-the-art discriminative dictionary learning approach. Beside that, a parallel implementation of feature extraction is deployed to make the system work real time. An extensive set of experiments has been conducted on four real-life datasets. The experimental results show that we can obtain the detection rate up to 100% on some datasets. We also get real time performance with a speed of image stream of about 40 images per second. The framework can be applied to emerging applications such as uniform detection, automated image tagging, content base image retrieval or online advertisement based on image content.

AB  - Now a day's, online reviews has become one of the most important part of any business. Posting reviews online for products bought or services received has become a trendy approach for people to express opinions and sentiments, which is essential for business intelligence, vendors and other interested parties. Social media like Twitter contains rich information about people's preferences. In this paper movie domain is considered for data mining. For dealing the problem of review mining for predicting sales performance, we have used massive collection of online reviews from IMDB along with thoughts of people about movies from Twitter; both are mined and processed by applying various algorithms. Our analysis shows that both Sentiments captured from reviews and tweets have a major impact on the future sales performance of the movie. For the sentiment factor, we have used Sentiment Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (S-PLSA) model it is a probabilistic approach to analyzing the sentiments in reviews and tweets, which provides succinct summary of the sentiment information. The summarization of both reviews and tweets in terms of sentiments along with additional input of the box office collection from IMDB is given to an Autoregressive Sentiment-Aware model (ARSA) for sales prediction. After that we have done sentiment analysis of online reviews. In sentiment analysis reviews are classified into negative and positive. We used a simple metric P-N ratio to predict the success of movies i.e. Hit, Average, Flop.

AB  - Sentiment analysis emerged as an important computational domain to gain insights from snippets of texts, as social media recently gained popularity. Text mining has long been a fundamental data analytic for sentiment analysis. One of the popular preprocessing approaches in text mining is transforming text strings to word vectors which form a high-dimensional sparse matrix. This sparse matrix poses challenges to induction of an accurate sentiment classification model. Feature selection is usually applied for finding a subset of features from all the original features from the sparse matrix, in order to enhance the accuracy of the classification model. In this paper, a new feature selection method called Optimized Swarm Search-based Feature Selection (OS-FS) is proposed. OS-FS is a swarm-type of searching function that selects an ideal subset of features for enhanced classification accuracy. The swarm search in OS-FS is optimized by a new feature evaluation technique called Clustering-by-Coefficient-of-Variation (CCV). The proposed scheme is verified via a mood classification scenario where 100 sample news are extracted from CNN.com. One of six human emotions (or sentiments) would have to be recognized from the news contents, by computer using text mining. The results show superiority of OS-FS over the traditional feature selection methods.

AB  - With the rapid development of wireless communication and mobile Internet, mobile phone becomes ubiquitous and functions as a versatile and a smart system, on which people frequently interact with various mobile applications (Apps). Understanding human behaviors using mobile phone is significant for mobile system developers, for human-centered system optimization and better service provisioning. In this paper, we focus on mobile user behavior analysis and prediction based on mobile Internet traffic data. Real traffic flow data is collected from the public network of Internet service providers, by high-performance network traffic monitors. We construct a User-App bipartite network to represent the traffic interaction pattern between users and App servers. After mining the explicit and implicit features from the User-App bipartite network, we propose two positive and unlabeled (PU) learning methods, including Spy-based PU learning and K-means-based PU learning, for App usage prediction and mobile video traffic identification. We first use the traffic flow data of QQ, a very famous messaging and social media application possessing high market share in China, as the experimental data set for App usage prediction task. Then, we use the traffic flow data from six popular Apps, including video intensive Apps (Youku, Baofeng, LeTV, and Tudou) and other Apps (Meituan and Apple), as the experimental data set for mobile video traffic identification task. Experimental results show that our proposed PU learning methods perform well in both tasks.

AB  - Scientific literature is growing at a rapid pace. Meanwhile, various stakeholders need to grasp novel trends and innovations in order to make sound policy decisions in real time. Modern data mining techniques can be leveraged to ease the burden of manually combing through thousands of documents. In this paper we present a data product for exploration and filtration of a large corpus of citations from several distinct commercial databases. The end goal is a highly interactive user interface for intuitive corpus exploration on the front end, supported by data ingestion, merging, inference, and novelty detection capabilities on the back end. Due to the high dimensionality of textual data, dimensionality reduction and summarization are major requirements for effective exploratory analysis. Toward these ends we apply a topic model, specifically the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The resulting dimensionality reduction improves the comprehensibility of the corpus for the end user, while also allowing a speedup of document-document comparison. Document similarity is computed using Hellinger distance, which is a Euclidean distance in a transformed topic-weight space, and thus nearest document queries can be implemented efficiently using a kd-tree data structure. Further information reduction is achieved through the use of a supervised nonparametric trend detection algorithm originally developed in the context of social media (Twitter), in order to suggest terms of potential interest to the user based on their likelihood of embodying significant trends. To our knowledge the application of this technique in the scientometric domain is novel.

AB  - Characteristics of a point-of-interest (POI) can be discovered by mining geo-tagged textual data from social media around the POI. However, the relevance of the data to the POI varies according to the distance between the POI and the positions in which the data are generated. That is, the textual data generated in positions far from the POI usually have nothing to do with the POI. Therefore, it is of importance to know a POI boundary that sufficiently covers geo-tagged textual data relevant to the POI. This paper proposed Boundary-dependent Explicit Semantic Analysis (BESA) to detect a boundary of a POI. BESA represents the POI boundary as a circle centered at the POI, but radius of the circle is unknown. If the radius is specified as a certain distance from the POI, textual data generated within the circular boundary are reduced into a topic vector where each topic is a Wikipedia concept. The number of Wikipedia concepts is fixed, but their enormous quantity allows BESA to explore variation of topics according to different circular boundaries. In order to approximate the best fit boundary, we regard a POI as circles with increasing radii. By exploring the topical similarities between the vector of a POI center and those of distant positions, the boundary of the POI is determined. The similarities reveal changes of geographical topics from the POI center as the radius of the POI increases. Thus the boundary of the POI is set with the radius at which the similarity declines drastically. According to the experiments with five different POIs, top 20 highly weighed topics are more relevant to the POIs within the boundaries detected by the proposed method rather than within the POI centers and within boundaries next larger than the detected boundaries. The results prove plausibility of BESA in detecting boundaries of POIs.

AB  - When mining user streams from social media, activity gaps are inevitable, which is known as the sparsity of user data. Such sparsity can significantly degrade the performance of a predictive system that relies on time-sensitive user content. To mitigate this issue, conventional approaches generally tend to discard periods with missing data. However, this solution leads to neglecting information generated by other users which, if utilized, could potentially enhance the quality of the predictive model. So the following question arises: is it possible to alleviate the impact of absent data while preserving the available content contributed within the same timespan? Despite the fact that this problem is well-known, it has not been thoroughly studied before. The goal of this work is to find a way of interpolating missing data from user's network and his previous activities. We investigate how different types of user profiles affect overall behavior predictability. Proposed models are evaluated on a case study of a micro-blogging system for the investment community.

AB  - The great influx of Medical-Web data makes the task of computer-assisted gathering and interpretation of Social Media-based Epidemic Intelligence (SM-EI) a very challenging one. State-of-the-art approaches usually use supervised machine learning algorithms to gather data from a variety of sources in this medical ecosystem, mining this data for specific event patterns and information discovery. Supervised approaches not only limit the type of detectable events, but also requires learning examples be given to the machine learning algorithm in advance. On the other hand, the more generic and flexible unsupervised machine learning methods currently produce such complex results, that the domain experts are not capable of assessing the results in a natural and efficient manner. In this paper, we present a novel framework with which SM-EI field practitioners can interact with medical ecosystem data, and assess the results of such complex unsupervised SM-EI algorithms. The assessment framework and the unsupervised epidemic event detection algorithm have been fully implemented and a quantitative study is presented to show the validity of the new approach to SM-EI.

AB  - Stakeholders working in open-source software development use social media, emails or any available means in the Internet to communicate and express what they want or need through the use of text. The recognition of such needs or desires (that we call intentions) is usually done by a human reader, and it can require a considerable effort when the amount of messages in online discussions increases. The problem is that to support an automated recognition of the intentions hidden in the text, data are needed in the domain of software development for training classifiers. However, so far there is no data annotated with intentions that can be used for data mining purposes. In order to tackle the lack of data we have collected online discussions in the domain of software development and asked people to annotate such discussions with intentions. This collection has been performed by crowd sourcing the task of annotating sentences with their hidden intention. In this paper we report the experience of carrying out a crowd sourcing project with a heterogeneous crowd. We discuss how we applied the steps of the crowd sourcing workflow in Crowd Intent. Lessons learned and future work are also presented.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is attracting more and more attentions and has become a very hot research topic due to its potential applications in personalized recommendation, opinion mining, etc. Most of the existing methods are based on either textual or visual data and can not achieve satisfactory results, as it is very hard to extract sufficient information from only one single modality data. Inspired by the observation that there exists strong semantic correlation between visual and textual data in social medias, we propose an end-to-end deep fusion convolutional neural network to jointly learn textual and visual sentiment representations from training examples. The two modality information are fused together in a pooling layer and fed into fully-connected layers to predict the sentiment polarity. We evaluate the proposed approach on two widely used data sets. Results show that our method achieves promising result compared with the state-of-the-art methods which clearly demonstrate its competency.

AB  - Many recent publications deal with trend analysis, event detection or opinion mining on social media data. Twitter, as the most important microblogging service, is often in the focus of these works, as it offers free access to big volumes of data. The free access, on that many publications rely, is composed of a random subset of the complete public status stream. Publications rely particularly on the uniform distribution of tweets in this sample stream, and therefore, till today, one has to trust in the statement of Twitter that the sample data is indeed uniformly distributed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In our research on the technical properties of Twitter's streaming data, we found evidence for discovering the method used by Twitter to decide which tweets will show up in the random sample streams. A deeper insight into this process leads to the possible reasons of why Twitter chose the presented sampling method. For this purpose we provide an overview of how Twitter's unique tweet IDs are generated and explain the regularities of each part of a tweet ID. This results also in some information about the tweet ID generating infrastructure of Twitter and what kind of knowledge can possibly be derived from small features like the tweet ID.

AB  - Mobile users participate in numerous social media applications that revolve around user locations, and receive customized services and recommendations tailored to their whereabouts. Large amounts of trajectory data become available as a byproduct of such services. Studying such data reveals travel patterns which can benefit transportation planning, public safety, etc. However, disclosing such data may lead to serious breaches of privacy. We propose a privacy-preserving approach to mining representative travel patterns using differential privacy (DP). Our solution consists of a sampling algorithm based on the exponential mechanism (EM) of DP which uses public road network information to increase sanitization accuracy. Extensive experimental results on realistic workloads show that the proposed protection technique preserves data precision and is computationally efficient.

AB  - Discovering semantic coherent topics from the large amount of user-generated content (UGC) in social media would facilitate many downstream applications of intelligent computing. Topic models, as one of the most powerful algorithms, have been widely used to discover the latent semantic patterns in text collections. However, one key weakness of topic models is that they need documents with certain length to provide reliable statistics for generating coherent topics. In Twitter, the users' tweets are mostly short and noisy. Observations of word co-occurrences are incomprehensible for topic models. To deal with this problem, previous work tried to incorporate prior knowledge to obtain better results. However, this strategy is not practical for the fast evolving UGC in Twitter. In this paper, we first cluster the users according to the retweet network, and the users' interests are mined as the prior knowledge. Such data are then applied to improve the performance of topic learning. The potential cause for the effectiveness of this approach is that users in the same community usually share similar interests, which will result in less noisy sub-data sets. Our algorithm pre-learns two types of interest knowledge from the data set: the interest-word-sets and a tweet-interest preference matrix. Furthermore, a dedicated background model is introduced to judge whether a word is drawn from the background noise. Experiments on two real life twitter data sets show that our model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

AB  - With the increasing use of Web 2.0 platforms such as Web Blogs, discussion forums, Wikis, and various other types of social media, people began to share their experiences and opinions about products or services on the World Wide Web. Web Blogs have thus become an important source of information. In turn, great interest in blog mining has arisen, specifically due to its potential applications, such as in opinion or review search engine applications the ability to collect and analyze data. In this study, we introduce an architecture, implementation, and evaluation of a Web blog mining application, called the BlogMiner, which extracts and classifies people's opinions and emotions (or sentiment) from the contents of weblogs about movie reviews.

AB  - Social media has recently become a rich resource in mining user sentiments. In this paper, Twitter has been chosen as a platform for opinion mining in trading strategy with Mubasher products, which is a leading stock analysis software provider in the Gulf region. This experiment proposes a model for sentiment analysis of Saudi Arabic (standard and Arabian Gulf dialect) tweets to extract feedback from Mubasher products. A hybrid of natural language processing and machine learning approaches on building models are used to classify tweets according to their sentiment polarity into one of the classes positive, negative and neutral. Firstly, document's Pre-processing are explored on the dataset. Secondly, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are applied with different feature selection schemes like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and BTO (Binary-Term Occurrence). Thirdly, the proposed model for sentiment analysis is expanded to obtain the results for N-Grams term of tokens. Finally, human has labelled the data and this may involve some mistakes in the labelling process. At this moment, neutral class with generalisation of our classification will take results to different classification accuracy.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of mining users' interest from the vast, noise, unstructured and dynamic data generated on social media sites, taking Twitter as case study. The mining process uses different Natural Language Processing techniques to extract the relevant words from subscribers' tweets and applies cluster analysis over them. We evaluate the performance of three different tag clustering algorithms -PAM, Affinity Propagation and UPGMA- when considering the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia as external source for semantic closeness among words. We provide a solution which can be developed without any a-priori knowledge about the number and category of topics, neither a priori knowledge about the users we are applying the extraction for. This solution is based on using an unsupervised measure of the clustering quality (Silhouette width) to estimate the parameters of the cluster analysis. Finally, as human feedback is not as reliable as expected, we validate the approach by using Twitter hash tags - the implicit classifying method used by Twitter users to organise their tweets.

People share news, opinions and information to support or against media. The most petrified topic is the ISIS terrorist attacks taking place around the world. ISIS takes advantage of the social media to continuously communicate using coded words or to establish their indirect presence. Hashtags associated with ISIS can be analyzed and capture the sentiment of the tweets. This paper presents a novel process for sentiment analysis on the ISIS related tweets and to organize the opinions with their geolocations. The Jeffrey Breen algorithm is used for sentiment analysis. The data mining algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Bagging, Decision Trees and Maximum Entropy are applied for polarity based classification of ISIS related Tweets. The results are compared and presented.

AB  - Geo-located social media provide a wealth of information that describes urban areas based on user descriptions and comments. Such data makes possible to identify meaningful city neighborhoods on the basis of the footprints left by a large and diverse population that uses this type of media. In this paper, we present some methods to exhibit the predominant activities and their associated urban areas to automatically describe a whole city. Based on a suitable attributed graph model, our approach identifies neighborhoods with homogeneous and exceptional characteristics. We introduce the novel problem of exceptional sub-graph mining in attributed graphs and propose a complete algorithm that takes benefits from new upper bounds and pruning properties. We also propose an approach to sample the space of exceptional sub-graphs within a given time-budget. Experiments performed on 10 real datasets are reported and demonstrate the relevancy and the limits of both approaches.

AB  - In self-regulated learning, evaluation is a complex task of the teaching process, but even more if students have social media that allow them to build their personal learning environment in different ways. In these kind of virtual environments a large amount of data that needs to be assessed by teachers is generated, and therefore they require tools that facilitate the assessment task. In this paper, we present an experiment with a process mining-based learning analytics tool, called SoftLearn, that helps teachers to assess the student's activity in self-regulated learning. The subject of this experiment is taught in blended learning mode with weekly classroom sessions, and the students use a social network software, called ELGG, as an e-portfolio in which they reflect their individual knowledge process construction. The results show that the use of this tool reduces significantly the assessment time and helps teachers to understand the learning process of the students.

AB  - With the significant growth of user-generated content on the Web, sentiment analysis has gained increasing importance to draw insights of online social data and turn it into a valuable asset for supporting decision making. Lots of efforts have adopted text mining techniques with linguistic features to detect and track people's opinions. Yet, the results are not satisfactory. In this paper, we aim at exploring the impact of combining emojis based features, which are pictographic symbols that are becoming more commonly used in social media, with various forms of textual features on the sentiment classification of dialectical Arabic tweets. We extract textual features using four different methods: Bag-of-Words (BoW), Latent Semantic Analysis, and two forms of Word Embedding. The effect of fusing emojis with textual features is analyzed using a support vector classifier with and without feature selection. It has been observed that simpler models can be constructed with much better results when emojis are merged with word embedding and the selection of the most relevant subset of features as input to the classifier.

AB  - This paper contributes to the emerging field of social-analytics in computer-supported cooperative work by introducing a novel methodology for investigating the "work-networks" that emerge from everyday interactions among workers, artifacts, and organizational structures. Particularly, it presents and discusses an early implementation of this methodology in the context of a large, global IT service delivery organization. It analyzes the pattern of work interactions that emerge from the mining of common use of internal social media systems, log data of service delivery management systems, and organizational structures. Such analyses enabled us to unearth potential deficiencies in the ways in which the organization make use of collaborative systems, share and spread knowledge among its workers.

AB  - Entrepreneurs have been subjects of great interest among researchers since they are commonly recognized as important players for economic growth worldwide. A variety of studies have already been conducted, in which entrepreneurs motivations, emotions, choices, income, behavior, personality, and thinking, amongst others, were analyzed. However, little has been investigated about the interactions of entrepreneurs within the context of online social networks, and even less at a geographical level where they develop their duties. Two of the well-known organizations in the world, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Consortium and the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute (GEDI), provide valuable insights about the entrepreneurial activity and the countries' entrepreneurship ecosystems, based on several dimensions. Yet, none of such dimensions have taken into account the speech of entrepreneurs in social media, and the reproducibility of such studies presents considerable limitations as they are very costly and highly demanding. The present study proposes a framework to fetch users, grouped by their country of residence, from a target community in the micro-blogging platform Twitter. By using natural language processing and data mining techniques over psycholinguistic dimensions present on 219M posts, authored by 135K entrepreneurs of 65 countries, we found significant differences in their speech. Results indicate that African entrepreneurs show higher scores regarding negative emotions than the rest of the entrepreneurs' population. In addition to this, we found that entrepreneurs from developed countries exhibit higher scores in positive emotions than other entrepreneurs in the world.

AB  - Mining users'= topics of interest is one of the most important tasks for social media services. Given known topic associations for some fraction of the users in an online microblogging platform, our goal is to infer the topics of interest for the remaining users in the same site. Specifically, we proposed a novel bi-relational graph model to capture the interactions among users and their shared topics of interests. The proposed graph model contains two sub-graphs: one corresponds to users and the other corresponds to topics. Such a representation allows for effective exploitation of both user homophily relation and topic correlation simultaneously. This is in contrast with previous work where these two factors are considered in isolation. Subsequently, the user interest discovery problem is formulated as a multi-label learning problem on the bi-relational graph, with the goal to estimate the optimized associations between user nodes and topic nodes across the two sub-graphs. Our experiment is carried out with a complete month-long data collected from Twitter and Tumblr via GNIP Decahose&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Firehose&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. The large-scale studies shed light on the effectiveness of inferring user interests based on the underlying social connections.

AB  - This paper explores approaches for the effective integration of several focal areas of advanced analytics on currently achievable big data platforms to enable timely, and maximally effective, geofence-triggered interventions (push marketing) that leverages viral or exponential returns. The viral or exponential growth behavior of modern social media-based interactions has garnered much attention in both public and private circles. The potential for harnessing and controlling these epidemic-like dynamics of spread or diffusion represent a significant and, as yet, underdeveloped marketing approach. This is especially true in the context of geo-fencing strategies and designs. Despite the potential for highly-leveraged returns for location-based services (LBS) several barriers remain. Due to privacy concerns, legal issues, the immaturity of big analytics, and constraints presented by physical-level communications and geo-tracking enabling technology, LBS has remained underdeveloped and under-actualized. This reality is rapidly changing. This paper focuses on recent developments in big analytics, especially the integration of social networking dynamics, text mining, semantics, dynamic behavioral profiling, and real-time trigger-based geo-sensing capabilities that are enabling the next generation of high performance direct digital marketing services.

AB  - Recent evolutions of social networks, virtual environments, Web technologies and 3D virtual worlds motivate the adoption of new technologies in education, opening successive innovative possibilities. These technologies (or tools) can be employed in distance education scenarios, or can also enhance traditional learning-teaching (blended or hybrid learning scenario). It is known and a wide advocated issue that laboratory practice is essential to technical education, foremost in engineering. In order to develop a feasible implementation to this research area, a prototype was developed, called 3DAutoSysLab, in which a metaverse is used as social collaborative interface, experiments (real or simulated) are linked to virtual objects, learning objects are displayed as interactive medias, and guiding/feedback are supported via an autonomous tutoring system based on user's interaction data mining. This prototype is under test, but preliminary applied results indicate great acceptance and increase of motivation of students.

AB  - Big data increasingly benefit both research and industrial area such as health care, finance service and commercial recommendation. This paper presents a personalized travel sequence recommendation from both travelogues and community contributed photos and the heterogeneous metadata (e.g., tags, geo-location, and date taken) associated with these photos. Unlike most existing travel recommendation approaches, our approach is not only personalized to user's travel interest but also able to recommend a travel sequence rather than individual Points of Interest (POIs). Topical package space including representative tags, the distributions of cost, visiting time and visiting season of each topic, is mined to bridge the vocabulary gap between user travel preference and travel routes. We take advantage of the complementary of two kinds of social media: travelogue and community contributed photos. We map both user's and routes' textual descriptions to the topical package space to get user topical package model and route topical package model (i.e., topical interest, cost, time and season). To recommend personalized POI sequence, first, famous routes are ranked according to the similarity between user package and route package. Then top ranked routes are further optimized by social similar users' travel records. Representative images with viewpoint and seasonal diversity of POIs are shown to offer a more comprehensive impression. We evaluate our recommendation system on a collection of 7 million Flickr images uploaded by 7,387 users and 24,008 travelogues covering 864 travel POIs in nine famous cities, and show its effectiveness. We also contribute a new dataset with more than 200 K photos with heterogeneous metadata in nine famous cities.

AB  - Graph visualization is often used for a representation of interconnected relations of entities. Individual entities such as cells, humans, computers, users, and other entities are represented as vertices while edges are used for entities' relations. With the visualization, people can get more information from the graph. There are already many tools for graph visualization of social media data. However, those tools need a specific file input format before generating a graph and visualizing it. In this research, we tried to do experiment and analysed data transformation from Twitter raw data to a JSON file format that can be used for most of the web-based network visualization tools. Using those techniques, we can decrease the memory usage by 1,526.1 MB and increase graph formation running time by 1,718.75 seconds. Those techniques can also be added with Text Mining modules for online context analysis of network visualization.

AB  - For many applications, such as targeted advertising and content recommendation, knowing users' traits and interests is a prerequisite. User profiling is a helpful approach for this purpose. However, current methods, i.e. self-reporting, web-activity monitoring and social media mining are either intrusive or require data over long periods of time. Recently, there is growing evidence in cognitive science that a variety of users' profile is significantly correlated with eye-tracking data. A novel just-in-time implicit profiling method, Eye-2-I, which learns the user's demographic and personality traits from the eye-tracking data while the user is watching videos is proposed. Although seemingly conspicuous by closely monitoring the user's eye behaviors, the proposed method is unobtrusive and privacy-preserving owing to its unique combination of speed and implicitness. As a proof-of-concept, the proposed method is evaluated in a user study with 51 subjects.

AB  - The development of IoT technologies and the massive admiration and acceptance of social media tools and applications, new doors of opportunity have been opened for using data analytics in gaining meaningful insights from unstructured information. The application of opinion mining and sentiment analysis (OMSA) in the era of big data have been used a useful way in categorizing the opinion into different sentiment and in general evaluating the mood of the public. Moreover, different techniques of OMSA have been developed over the years in different data sets and applied to various experimental settings. In this regard, this paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review, aims to discuss both technical aspect of OMSA (techniques and types) and non-technical aspect in the form of application areas are discussed. Furthermore, this paper also highlighted both technical aspects of OMSA in the form of challenges in the development of its technique and non-technical challenges mainly based on its application. These challenges are presented as a future direction for research.

AB  - As social media has become increasingly popular in the modern world, people are using these platforms to express their opinions about products, businesses, and services. The need for categorizing these consumer reviews has been prominent. One effective solution is sentiment analysis (SA), which has been an active research topic. The goal of SA is to automatically extracting and classifying user opinions. Pervious research works however have not shown satisfied results. In this paper, a multilayer architecture is proposed to increase the performance of multiclass classification. The framework includes data-preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classifier building. The framework is a two-layer classification, choosing from Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression as base models, and using a voting scheme to obtain the final predicted class. The proposed model is applied to more than 1.3 million restaurant reviews from the Yelp Challenge dataset. We have achieved a high accuracy of 86% for cross validation, and using real-world online review data as test data, we have achieved an accuracy of 80%. The results show that the proposed framework has greatly improved classification accuracy while comparing with those using single-layer architectures. We believe that the proposed method may be applied to, and would have significant contributions to other areas of opinion mining.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in sentiment analysis on consumer reviews to understand the opinion polarity on social media. However, little attention has been paid to the development of deep learning for sentiment analysis on consumer reviews in Chinese. The research objective of this paper is to explore the impact of deep learning for sentiment analysis on Google Play consumer reviews in Chinese. A web mining technique was implemented for collecting 196,651 reviews on Google Play. We used Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model, Naïve Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches for sentiment analysis on consumer reviews and compared the experimental results. The experimental results suggest that the accuracy of deep learning for sentiment analysis on Google Play consumer review achieves 94% and deep learning approach outperforms Naïve Bayes (74.12%) and Support Vector Machine (76.46%) in the present study. Our finding confirmed that sentiment analysis on Google Play consumer review with deep learning is outstanding. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, the present study confirmed sentiment analysis with deep learning on Google Play consumer review may improve the accuracy of prediction. Second, we create a sentiment dictionary named iSGoPaSD for Google Play review. Third, the study compared the result of average sampling data and non-average sampling data. We found that deep learning method with non-average sampling data reached the better performance.

AB  - A large amount of traffic-related data, including traffic statistics, accident statistics, road information, and drivers' and pedestrians' comments, is being collected through sensors and social media networks. We focus on the issue of extracting traffic risk factors from such heterogeneous data and ranking locations according to the extracted factors. In general, it is difficult to define traffic risk. We may adopt a clustering approach to identify groups of risky locations, where the risk factor is extracted by comparing the groups. Furthermore, we may utilize prior knowledge about partially ordered relations such that a specific location should be more risky than others. In this paper, we propose a novel method for traffic risk mining by unifying the clustering approach with prior knowledge with respect to order relations. Specifically, we propose the partially ordered non-negative matrix factorization (PONMF) algorithm, which is capable of clustering locations under partially ordered relations among them. The key idea is to employ the multiplicative update rule as well as the gradient descent rule for parameter estimation. Through experiments conducted using synthetic and real data sets, we show that PONMF can identify clusters that include high-risk roads and extract their risk factors.

AB  - Computer Vision and Image Processing are emerging research paradigms. The increasing popularity of social media, micro- blogging services and ubiquitous availability of high-resolution smartphone cameras with pervasive connectivity are propelling our digital footprints and cyber activities. Such online human footprints related with an event-of-interest, if mined appropriately, can provide meaningful information to analyze the current course and pre- and post- impact leading to the organizational planning of various real-time smart city applications. In this paper, we investigate the narrative (texts) and visual (images) components of Twitter feeds to improve the results of queries by exploiting the deep contexts of each data modality. We employ Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)-based techniques to analyze the texts and Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) to analyze the images which help establish the cross-correlations between the textual and image dimensions of a query. While each of the data dimensions helps improve the results of a specific query on its own, the contributions from the dual modalities can potentially provide insights that are greater than what can be obtained from the individual modalities. We validate our proposed approach using real Twitter feeds from a recent devastating flash flood in Ellicott City near the University of Maryland campus. Our results show that the images and texts can be classified with 67\% and 94\% accuracies respectively.

AB  - Named entity recognition (NER) is an important and very effective for the Machine Translation, Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) from huge corpus, Question Answering (QA) system, text Mining and text clustering and etc. NER help us to classify or identify the Noun and its types such place /location, people, department, Ministry, organization, times and etc. The huge data available on social Media, websites, news channels and many more sources can be classified so that it can be used in research for NLP processes such as in Machine Translation, Speech Technology, Information Extraction and etc. To process this huge data or corpus we propose recent techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network. The Deep Neural Network approach will help to identify the Named entity (NE) from huge corpus or text by training the corpus using Word2vec approach. On the basis of fetched tokens and tag. We categorize these tokens into different Grammar categories based of cosine similarity concept of Deep Neural Network. Cosine similarity help to find the tag of unknown token or phases by finding its neared Vectors which are not trained earlier in Word2vec database. We have used the supervised learning (SL) techniques to train the network.

AB  - In this study, we apply data mining tools to generate interesting patterns for predicting box office performance of movies using data collected from multiple social media and web sources including Twitter, YouTube and the IMDb movie database. The prediction is based on decision factors derived from a historical movie database, followers count from Twitter, and sentiment analysis of YouTube viewers' comments. We label the prediction in three classes, Hit, Neutral and Flop, using Weka's K-Means clustering tool. Interesting patterns for prediction are generated by Weka's J48. Since our prediction is for movies yet to be released in summer 2013, the performance of the final results will be validated by a follow-up study.

AB  - With all these smart devices around us, and the spread of the Internet and emerging technologies, our life became easier and busier. The un-controlled excessive use of the mobile applications and social media made many of the people around the world feel they are alone, and socializing with electronic devices rather than human beings. This problem is more sever when it comes to the elderly people who are already in excessive need for healthcare and socializing. In this research, we present a Context-aware and private real-time fall detection system (FDS) for elderly people. The proposed system consists of sensor pad placed under a carpet; the electronics reads walking activity to provide an automated health monitoring and alert system. We extended the functionalities of the smart carpet to improve its ability to detect falls, alert health care personnel, by providing a real-time, long-term access, and monitoring event system. The sensed data is stored in the cloud, and analyzed using data mining tools to enhance the system accuracy in detecting falls and monitor elderly people activities. The user can obtain these results and make decisions by accessing the cloud through his/her mobile devices and in real time manner. Results showed that our system detects falls using computational intelligence techniques with 96.2% accuracy, 95% sensitivity and 85% Specificity.

AB  - Sharing economy becomes an emerging issue in urban life. It is not a new phenomenon but an assembling of existing techniques to meet specific demands of users. It also points out a better way to implicitly collect users' contexts and to understand users than the conventional one that requires much user involvement (e.g., tedious inputs). A universal model, for this purpose, that supports dynamic analysis and mining of user-generated content (or contexts) is designed in this paper. Two major factors, sensing and analysis of crowd preference and their decision-making behavior, are especially targeted. This model formulates the given scenario that comprehensively illustrates the possible actors and correlated actions among them with a set of rules to enhance the machine learning results. This model outlines a detail process on pre-/post-process of the data, and indicates the core techniques for user modeling. The raw data collected from on-service website, i.e., Airbnb, are utilized for the preliminary examination of our proposal. We especially look at internal factors (e.g., nationality, gender, and age) and external factors (e.g., device, social media, and time) that reflect implicitly the difference on crowd's preference and behavior. Results after statistics-based machine learning reveal that the relation among users' internal and external factors share high similarity with their behavior patterns, and can be applied, considering particular features, for service provision to a specific type of crowds.

AB  - Social media such as Twitter create space to explain the thoughts and opinions on various topics and different events, millions of users can share their ideas in this Micrblog, Therefore Twitter is converted as a source to exploration of information; make a decision and an analysis of sentiment. There is a sense in all of the texts, but it is more important to provide strategies for obtaining suitable forecasting and optimized usage of information for forecasting sentiment. Also Twitter information follows the stream model. In this model, data were arrived at high speed to destination. As a result, data mining algorithm should be able to predict user feeling in immediate time under limited space and time. The purpose of this paper is to examine the previous works online analysis of sentiment on Twitter.

AB  - The digital revolution, far from abating, continues with even greater intensity in new applications in health, media, social networking, and many other areas of our lives. These applications will require revolutionary improvements in speed and capacity in future microprocessors so that they can process terabytes of information with teraflops of terascale computing power. Tera is not an exaggeration: trillions of hertz and trillions of bytes will be needed. In a terascale world, there will be new processing capabilities for mining and interpreting the world's growing mountain of data, and for doing so with even greater efficiency. Examples of applications are artificial intelligence in smart cars and appliances and virtual reality for modeling, visualization, physics simulation, and medical training. Many other applications are still on the edge of science fiction. In these applications, massive amounts of data must be processed. Three-dimensional (3-D) images in connected visual computing applications like virtual worlds can include hundreds of hours of video, thousands of documents, and tens of thousands of digital photos that require indexing and searching. Terascale computing refers to this massive processing capability with the right mix of memory and input/output (I/O) capabilities for use in everyday devices, from servers to desktops to laptops.

AB  - Virtual public sphere, offering a new media to form the virtual public appeal and public opinion, broadens the regulation area between the country and society. From the construction and characteristics of virtual public sphere and on the basis of the description process, I try to construct the path of virtual community effect to public decision-making. On one hand, it will help to discuss the extension and reconstruction of cyber society to the realization of structure of social relation. On the other hand, it will furnish the scientific decision of public decision system and further normal development of network with the favourable basis and theory support. In this article, I take the public sphere by Habermas as the base and starting point and apply the Web data mining, data processing and event analyzing method, etc to analyze the structure, identity, and functional realization of virtual public community through case studies. Through the research, I find that, by comparison with the real public sphere, virtual public sphere has its unique structural characteristics and operational mechanism.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that a noticeable percentage of Web search traffic is about social events. While traditional Web sites can only show human-edited events, in this paper, we present a novel system to automatically detect events from search log data and generate storyboards where the events are arranged chronologically. We chose image search log as the resource for event mining, as search logs can directly reflect people's interests. To discover events from log data, we present a smooth nonnegative matrix factorization framework, which combines the information of query semantics, temporal correlations, search logs, and time continuity. Moreover, we consider the time factor to be an important element, since different events will develop in different time tendencies. In addition, to provide a media-rich and visually appealing storyboard, each event is associated with a set of representative photos arranged along a timeline. These relevant photos are automatically selected from image search results by analyzing image content features. We use celebrities as our test domain, which takes a large percentage of image search traffic. Experiments consisting of Web search traffic on 200 celebrities, for a period of six months, show very encouraging results compared with handcrafted editorial storyboards.

AB  - The massive adoption of social media has provided new ways for individuals to express their opinions online. The blogosphere, an inherent part of this trend, contains a vast array of information about a variety of topics. It is thus a huge think tank that creates an enormous and ever-changing archive of open source intelligence. Modeling and mining this vast pool of data to extract, exploit and describe meaningful knowledge in order to leverage (content-related) structures and dynamics of emerging networks within the blogosphere is the higher-level aim of the research presented here. This paper focuses on this project's initial phase, in which the above-mentioned data of interest needs to be collected and made available offline for further analyses. Our proprietary development of a tailor-made feed-crawler meets exactly this need. The main concept, the techniques and the implementation details of the crawler thus form the main interest of this paper and furthermore provide the basis for future project phases.

AB  - Social-media debates on longitudinal political topics often take the form of adversarial discussions: highly polarized user posts, favoring one of two opposing parties, over an extended time period. Recent prominent cases are the US Presidential campaign and the UK Brexit referendum. This paper approaches such discussions as a multi-faceted data space, and applies data mining to identify interesting patterns and factors of influence. Specifically, we study how topics are addressed by different parties, their factual and "post-factual" undertones, and the role of highly active "power users" on either side of the discussion.

AB  - In this era of big data, many domains on the web naturally have massive amount of labeled text data that are growing over time, for example, digital publication archives, social media posts, and question-answer forums. Probabilistic graphical models have shown great potential for mining such text corpora in recent years. Some of these algorithms utilize explicit annotations and labels associated with documents to guide the probabilistic model to find hidden themes. A few techniques attempt to utilize the timestamps associated with documents to model the evolution of those latent topics. However, no effort has been devoted to utilize these two different dimensions of information together - timestamps and labels or annotations - to discover evolution of labeled themes. In this paper, we present a new topical model called the Supervised Topical Evolution Model (STEM), which is a monolithic graphical model capable of using annotations, timestamps, and textual contents to discover interpretable and evolving themes from big text datasets. STEM simultaneously learns latent themes and their changes over time using a stochastic process that is driven by labels or annotations. In addition, we provide an asynchronously distributed inference process for STEM that results in significant speedup in learning time, making the model scalable for large datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is able to infer highly interpretable topics that reflect temporal patterns, in much less time than other comparable topic modeling methods.

AB  - Lately, there has been a growing trend in the Internet space particularly among the Online Social Media (OSMs) platforms like Twitter, Facebook etc which are becoming huge repositories of information. This information, by design, is posted by users of these websites and consequently, this information is vast, un-organized, unreliable and dynamic. It is commonly observed that along with genuine users, a lot of activity is seen from spammers or users with the intent of spreading malicious or irrelevant content. In our work, we focus on spamming activity on Twitter. Spamming activity in Twitter is can typically be reported by its users, who we refer as reporters and those who indulge in spamming activities are referred as reportees. We collected data of suspected spammers, i.e. reportees as well as of the users who reported them, i.e. reporters. Thereafter, we classified them into various categories and tried to study the ecosystem of these reportees and reporters. We used three data mining techniques i.e., decision tree, K-nearest neighbors and random forest classifier for the classification tasks. Finally, we have compared these three algorithms on the basis of their accuracy.

AB  - An improved understanding of customer preference is crucial for successful business in physical stores. Online stores are capable learning customer preference from the click logs and transaction records, while retailers with physical store still lack effective methods to in-depth understand customer preference. Fortunately, user-generated data from mobile devices and social media are providing rich information to uncover customer preference. In this paper, we present a novel approach to mine customer preference in physical stores from their interaction behaviors. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed model, we conduct a store-type recommendation model for physical stores by jointly considering the learned customer preference and temporal influence. We have performed a comprehensive experiment evaluation on two real-world data sets, which are collected by more than 120 000 customers during 12 months from two urban shopping malls. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model not only in recommending interesting stores for customer, but also help retailers better understand customer preference.

AB  - In recent years, a huge number of researchers have been paying attention for developing new data mining techniques to detect topics and events in posted data on social media sites. In this paper, we focus on geotagged tweets posted on the Twitter site, which are referred to as georeferenced documents including not only short text message but also posted time and location. Burstiness is one of the simplest and most effective criteria for identifying hot topics and events. Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm is the simplest but most remarkable algorithm for detecting bursts; however, it does not consider the localities of bursts in topics and events. In this paper, we propose a new method for identifying the burstiness of a local topic using the location-based burst detection algorithm with a classifier technique. The aim of this study is to develop a new location-based burst detection technique that can identify the local burstinesses of topics such as, natural disasters, weather, and diseases. To evaluate the proposed method, an actual sequence of batched georeferenced documents composed of crawling geotagged tweets was used. The proposed method could identify the local burstiness of a local topic related to weather in Japan.

AB  - In this paper we mine over 80 million twitter micro logs in order to explore whether data from this social media initiative can be used to identify sentiment about tourism and Thailand amid the unrest in that country during the early part of 2010 and further whether analysis of tweets can be used to discern the effect of that unrest on Phuket's tourism environment. It is proposed that this analysis can provide measurable insights through summarization, keyword analysis and clustering. We measure sentiment using a binary choice keyword algorithm. A multi-knowledge based approach is proposed using, Self-Organizing Maps along with sentiment polarity in order to model sentiment. We develop a visual model to express a sentiment concept vocabulary and then apply this model to maximums and minimums in the time series sentiment data. The results show actionable knowledge can be extracted in real time.

AB  - With the explosive growth of social media sites, an enormous amount of opinionated data has become numerically documented online. The explosion of this kind of data gives rise of new areas: sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Our purpose in this paper is to determine the polarity of Facebook comments "positive or negative" using machine learning-based approach. This approach requires an adequate vector representation of linguistic units (words or sentences) to obtain better classification performance. For this reason, we present a new emotional vector representation of words which can faithfully translate their semantic and sentimental characteristics, based on emotion symbols. Furthermore, we propose an enrichment step that aims to enlarge the lexicon and dynamically update word representation according to new contexts. Finally, by using these word representations, we present the comments in the same feature space to classify them and predict their polarity. We use Support Vector Machines to show that our emotional vector representation of lexicon's word and its enrichment significantly improves accuracy for sentiment analysis problem compared with the well-known bag-of-words vector representations, using dataset derived from Facebook. Our results are also consistent and effective.

AB  - According to NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health), 20 million Americans consumed drugs in the past few 30 days. Combating illicit drug use is of great interest to public health and law enforcement agencies. Despite of the importance, most of the existing studies on drug uses rely on surveys. Surveys on sensitive topics such as drug use may not be answered truthfully by the people taking them. Selecting a representative sample to survey is another major challenge. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using big multimedia data, including both images and text, from social media in order to discover drug use patterns at fine granularity with respect to demographics. Instagram posts are searched and collected by drug related terms by analyzing the hashtags supplied with each post. A large and dynamic dictionary of frequent drug related slangs is used to find these posts. User demographics are extracted using robust face image analysis algorithms. These posts are then mined to find common trends with regard to the time and location they are posted, and further in terms of age and gender of the drug users. Furthermore, by studying the accounts followed by the users of drug related posts, we extract common interests shared by drug users.

AB  - Shopping experience is important for both citizens and tourists. We present IntelligShop, a novel location-based augmented reality application that supports intelligent shopping experience in malls. As the key functionality, IntelligShop provides an augmented reality interface -- people can simply use ubiquitous smartphones to face mall retailers, then IntelligShop will automatically recognize the retailers and fetch their online reviews from various sources (including blogs, forums and publicly accessible social media) to display on the phones. Technically, IntelligShop addresses two challenging data mining problems, including robust feature learning to support heterogeneous smartphones in localization and learning to query for automatically gathering the retailer content from the Web for augmented reality. We demonstrate the system effectiveness via a test bed established in a real mall of Singapore.

AB  - Twitter is one of world most famous social media. There are many statement expresed in Twitter like happiness, sadness, public information, etc. Unfortunately, people may got angry to each other and write it down as a tweet on Twitter. Some tweet may contain Indonesian swear words. It's serious problem because many Indonesians may not tolerated swear words. Some Indonesian swear words may have multiple means, not always an Indonesian swear word means insulting. Twitter has provide tweet's data by account, trending topics, and advance keyword. This work try to analyze many tweet about political news, political event, and some Indonesian famous person because the tweet assumed contains many Indonesian swear word. The derived tweets will process in text mining and then analyzed by classification process using Naive Bayes Classifier, Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree to detect Indonesian swear word. This work expected to discover the high accurate classification model. It means, the model can differentiate the real meaning of Indonesian swear word contained in tweet.

AB  - Social media such as Twitter, Google+, Facebook, etc has an undeniable effect on the way information is stored and processed by us. The information available on the web is abound and hence it is essential to mine the important information and avoid the irrelevant details. Along with this, it is beneficial to consider information that is contextually similar to information related to a particular topic as it provides a big picture. Tweets contains keywords known as hashtags which provide useful information for the purpose of sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, event detection, etc. In this paper, we have analyzed Twitter data based on their hashtags, which is widely used nowadays. We have extracted tweets pertaining to a single keyword and to contextually similar keywords. For the purpose of finding similar words we have used word embeddings that capture contextual information successfully. We have used topic modeling to expose the latent structure of the documents based on probability distribution. The proposed framework helps user to find relevant tweets pertaining to a specific and to contextually similar hashtags.

AB  - In today's world, closed circuit television, cellphone photographs and videos, open-source intelligence (i.e., social media/web data mining), and other sources of photographic evidence are commonly used by police forces to identify suspects and victims of both online and offline crimes. Human characteristics, such as age, height, weight, gender, hair color, etc., are often used by police officers and witnesses in their description of unidentified suspects. In certain circumstances, the age of the victim can result in the determination of the crime's categorization, e.g., child abuse investigations. Various automated machine learning-based techniques have been implemented for the analysis of digital images to detect soft biometric traits, such as age and gender, and thus aid detectives and investigators in progressing their cases. This paper documents an evaluation of existing cognitive age prediction services. The evaluative and comparative analysis of the various services was conducted to identify trends and issues inherent to their performance. One significant contributing factor impeding the accurate development of the services investigated is the notable lack of sufficient sample images in specific age ranges, i.e., underage and elderly. To overcome this issue, a dataset generator was developed, which harnesses collections of several unbalanced datasets and forms a balanced, curated dataset of digital images annotated with their corresponding age and gender.

AB  - We describe a model for determining strategies for making decisions. Decision making involves a model with several possible actions, state of the world with a probability, and a metric of how well the best decision was made. The ability to perform data mining and discover patterns to automatically predict likelihood of reaction to specific events and situational awareness is enhanced from multiple social media inputs. We discuss development of a method for determining actionable information to efficiently propitiate manpower, equipment assets, or propaganda responses. Our solution combines a variety of textual content information in different formats to help with a decision process to include sources, systems, and services that control and influence a situation. Different viewpoints need to be understood that are points involved in the event. Our FeatureSEARCHTM tool is helpful for rapidly parsing text that has been extracted with an intelligent algorithm in order to evaluate the population sentiment for the targeted area. Our tool allows for calculating optimal strategies provides greater knowledge about the state of the world and increases the likelihood of a decision maker making the best decision. We discuss game theory using linear programming methods to solve for multiple possible strategies that are known. The decision maker's success depends upon his ability to correctly and automatically judge the multiple psychological and rational factors. The goal of our system, called GlobalSite, is to deliver trustworthy threat analysis systems and services that understand situations, while being a vital tool for continuing mission operations information.

AB  - Most sentiment analysis systems use bag-of-words approach for mining sentiments from the online reviews and social media data. Rather considering the whole sentence/ paragraph for analysis, the bag-of-words approach considers only individual words and their count as the feature vectors. This may mislead the classification algorithm especially when used for problems like sentiment classification. Traditional machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, SVM etc. are widely used to solve the classification problems. These machine learning algorithms often suffer from biasness towards a particular class. In this paper, we propose Natural Language (NLP) based approach to enhance the sentiment classification by adding semantics in feature vectors and thereby using ensemble methods for classification. Adding semantically similar words and context-sense identities to the feature vectors will increase the accuracy of prediction. Experiments conducted demonstrate that the semantics based feature vector with ensemble classifier outperforms the traditional bag-of-words approach with single machine learning classifier by 3-5%.

AB  - Government agencies, corporations, and police departments are plagued by information overload. The inability of fully analyze fragments of data scattered across the organizations reduces productivity, and more and more of these fragments are being gathered every day thanks to tools like the Internet and digital audio/video recorders. However, since much of this information is stored in computer systems and networks, it is possible to develop tools that will automatically analyze, assemble and associate the fragments so that precious human resources can focus on the analysis and interpretation of just those fragments that may contain valuable insight. Media analytics for actionable intelligence (MAAI) is a combination of automatic, semi-automatic and manual tools which provide three basic levels of analysis: automatic services, manual feedback, and higher level mining (e.g. timeline, social network, hypothesis generation) which allow investigators/analysts to act more efficiently and accurately.

AB  - The creation of interactive visualization to analyze text documents has gained an impressive momentum in recent years. This is not surprising in the light of massive and still increasing amounts of available digitized texts. Websites, social media, news wire, and digital libraries are just few examples of the diverse text sources whose visual analysis and exploration offers new opportunities to effectively mine and manage the information and knowledge hidden within them. A popular visualization method for large text collections is to represent each document by a glyph in 2D space. These landscapes can be the result of optimizing pairwise distances in 2D to represent document similarities, or they are provided directly as meta data, such as geo-locations. For well-defined information needs, suitable interaction methods are available for these spatializations. However, free exploration and navigation on a level of abstraction between a labeled document spatialization and reading single documents is largely unsupported. As a result, vital foraging steps for task-tailored actions, such as selecting subgroups of documents for detailed inspection, or subsequent sense-making steps are hampered. To fill in this gap, we propose DocuCompass, a focus+context approach based on the lens metaphor. It comprises multiple methods to characterize local groups of documents, and to efficiently guide exploration based on users' requirements. DocuCompass thus allows for effective interactive exploration of document landscapes without disrupting the mental map of users by changing the layout itself. We discuss the suitability of multiple navigation and characterization methods for different spatializations and texts. Finally, we provide insights generated through user feedback and discuss the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - The emergence of social media platforms has provided voluminous amounts of opinionated data. As businesses look to understand and exploit these variegated means of online expression, it has become necessary to automate the process of detecting the panorama of underlying themes. A challenging task is to detect the gradual transitions of context that occur within a text. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach for analyzing textual content that conveys multiple themes. It focuses on efficiently segregating the context switches in text, and then accurately mining the different opinions present. We utilize three categories of features namely positional, lexical-semantic and sentiment polarity for theme co-referent text segmentation within a document. We obtain a Beta Cubed F1 score of 0.7208 for theme co-referent text segmentation of fifty text documents obtained from the question-answer website Quora. The topics corresponding to the theme of each of these segments are obtained by using a noun phrase extractor. We further present an application of the proposed approach to improve the efficiency of Sentiment Analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the proficiency of the proposed scheme to segregate textual content by themes, identify meaningful topics inherent in the themes, compute the polarity, and also suggest the applicability of the method to query-based retrieval systems.

AB  - Analysis and mining of social media has become an important research area. A challenging problem in this area consists in the identification of a group of users with similar patterns. In this paper, we propose the classification of users based on their activity profiles (e.g., periods of the day when the user is most and least active in online communications). Activity profiles can be useful for many purposes, such as marketing and user behavior analysis. They can also serve as a basis for other techniques such as stylometric and time analysis in order to increase the precision and scalability of multiple aliases identification techniques. We have implemented a prototype tool and applied it on a dataset from the ICWSM data set Boards.ie, showing the usefulness of our classification.

AB  - Nowadays, review sites are more and more confronted with the spread of misinformation, i.e., opinion spam, which aims at promoting or damaging some target businesses, by misleading either human readers, or automated opinion mining and sentiment analysis systems. For this reason, in the last years, several data-driven approaches have been proposed to assess the credibility of user-generated content diffused through social media in the form of on-line reviews. Distinct approaches often consider different subsets of characteristics, i.e., features, connected to both reviews and reviewers, as well as to the network structure linking distinct entities on the review-site in exam. This article aims at providing an analysis of the main review- and reviewer-centric features that have been proposed up to now in the literature to detect fake reviews, in particular from those approaches that employ supervised machine learning techniques. These solutions provide in general better results with respect to purely unsupervised approaches, which are often based on graph-based methods that consider relational ties in review sites. Furthermore, this work proposes and evaluates some additional new features that can be suitable to classify genuine and fake reviews. For this purpose, a supervised classifier based on Random Forests have been implemented, by considering both well-known and new features, and a large-scale labeled dataset from which all these features have been extracted. The good results obtained show the effectiveness of new features to detect in particular singleton fake reviews, and in general the utility of this study.

AB  - Wikipedia is considered to be one of the most famous online encyclopedias. We study the issues related to trending articles on Arabic Wikipedia and how it is influenced by certain external stimulants: for example, breaking news, celebrities' tweets, special events from the past, instant messages on any social media application or any other reasons that could affect the Arabic Wikipedia articles in terms of the number of visitors, which we named the popularity level. By using a data- and text- mining techniques, and the software platform Rapidminer, we developed two models that enabled us to predict the popularity level of Arabic articles on Wikipedia, depending on the features of their stimulants.

AB  - Given the proliferation of review content, and the fact that reviews are highly diverse and often unnecessarily verbose, users frequently face the problem of selecting the appropriate reviews to consume. Micro-reviews are emerging as a new type of online review content in the social media. Micro-reviews are posted by users of check-in services such as Foursquare. They are concise (up to 200 characters long) and highly focused, in contrast to the comprehensive and verbose reviews. In this paper, we propose a novel mining problem, which brings together these two disparate sources of review content. Specifically, we use coverage of micro-reviews as an objective for selecting a set of reviews that cover efficiently the salient aspects of an entity. Our approach consists of a two-step process: matching review sentences to micro-reviews, and selecting a small set of reviews that cover as many micro-reviews as possible, with few sentences. We formulate this objective as a combinatorial optimization problem, and show how to derive an optimal solution using Integer Linear Programming. We also propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that approximates the optimal solution. Finally, we perform a detailed evaluation of all the steps of our methodology using data collected from Foursquare and Yelp.

AB  - The massive adoption of social media has provided new ways for individuals to express their opinions online. The blogosphere, an inherent part of this trend, contains a vast array of information about a variety of topics. Thus, it is a huge think tank that creates an enormous and ever-changing archive of open source intelligence. Modeling and mining this vast pool of data to extract and describe meaningful knowledge in order to leverage (content-related) structures and dynamics of emerging networks within the blogo sphere is the higher-level aim of the research presented here. While the concept of our tailor-mode feed-crawler was already discussed in two earlier publications this paper focuses on our approach to extend the earlier feed crawler to a more universal and highly scalable blog-crawler.

AB  - Personalized e-learning systems are mainly structured based on two basic models: domain model and user model. When considering personalization in a collaborative environment with user-generated content via Web 2.0 technologies, the task of generating the models is very challenging. This paper presents an approach to extract information related to the domain model and user model for the purpose of personalization. The extraction is using chat conversations using different social media tools during collaborative learning as sources for the text analysis. Text mining technique has been incorporated to clean the collected data and extract the required information.

AB  - People of all walks of life use social media for communications and networking. Their active participation in numerous and diverse online activities continually generates massive amounts of social media data. This undoubtedly “big” data presents new challenges to data mining, including how to select salient features for social media data with varied relations, how to assess user vulnerability, and how to ensure that patterns discovered from social media data are valid when no ground truth is available. We will illustrate the intricacies of social media data, present original social-computing problems, deliberate approaches to mining social media data to gain insight from real-world applications and deepen our understanding, and exploit unique characteristics of social media data in developing novel algorithms and computational tools for social media mining.

AB  - Now social Data are increases very fast, in every area social data play an important role in every angle, social media big data mining area welcomed by researchers from both government, academic and industry. A computing sentiment of news data is a significant component of the social media big data. The computing sentiment of news information may be a major factor of the social media massive information. In current web word range of user use social media and social network to browse and read news connected information. Everyday range of issue area unit occurring and social media influence the news associated with this news. Existing sentiment computing ways area unit primarily supported the feeling wordbook or supervised ways, that aren't climbable to the social media massive information. As a result of once bid information suggests that information size increases this methodology result on potency. Therefore we tend to propose a replacement methodology to try and do the sentiment analysis for news data a lot of specially, supported the social media information and social news (i.e.text and emotions text) of a happening, a Levenshtein algorithm is made to together categorical its linguistics and emotions, that lays the muse for the happening sentiment analysis. The word feeling computation algorithmic rule is planned to get the beginning word feeling that area unit more refined through the quality emotion wordbook. With the word emotions in hand, we are able to reason each sentence sentiments. The proposed method uses Naïve Bayes and Levenshtein algorithm to determine the emotion into different categories from given social media news data. This method provides the excellent performance for real time news data on social media and also provides the better result in terms of accuracy.

AB  - Gigantic amount of content is generated every second on the web. Blog posts, tweets, videos, uploaded images maintain the rich and increasing content of the social media. Great amount of information is obtained from social media through text mining techniques which are being improved and developed continuously. Due to the increasing variety of social media, data is flooding into every business and techniques of gathering information from unstructured data becomes a challenge. Processing and analyzing of large collections of social media text is difficult by using traditional single computer methods. Fortunately, with each passing day, the development and improvements in Big Data infrastructure are promising and the analysis capabilities are also increasing. This infrastructure supports language independent researches on text mining. There can be diversified searches with language-specific definitions and assumptions. Since many of the studies on social media text mining analysis focus on English language, this paper would help enhance text mining efficiently in Turkish language which is a word order free agglutinative language. The linguistic aspects of Turkish language make text mining complicated. Suffixes can change the word meanings easily. Word stemming becomes elaborated due to indigenous letters. The intent of this article is to demonstrate the issues, methods and applications of qualitative approaches that enable text mining in Turkish language considering its compelling features with covering preprocessing, feature selection and topic clustering on text mining considering Turkish linguistic features.

AB  - Social media data now enriches and supplements information flow in various sectors of society. The question addressed here is whether social media can act as a credible information source of sufficient quality to meet the needs of transport planners, operators, policy makers and the travelling public. A typology of primary transport data needs, current and new data sources is initially established, following which this study focuses on social media textual data in particular. Three sub-questions are investigated: the potential to use social media data alongside existing transport data, the technical challenges in extracting transport-relevant information from social media and the wider barriers to the uptake of this data. Following an overview of the text mining process to extract relevant information from the corpus, a review of the challenges this approach holds for the transport sector is given. These include ontologies, sentiment analysis, location names and measuring accuracy. Finally, institutional issues in the greater use of social media are highlighted, concluding that social media information has not yet been fully explored. The contribution of this study is in scoping the technical challenges in mining social media data within the transport context, laying the foundation for further research in this field.

AB  - Data mining is a technique of extracting hidden predictive information from large databases. The important information discovery from the data is more needed in many areas like industries, education, web mining, text mining, etc. Among this text mining is very important in social media. Text mining also referred as the process of deriving information from text. A social media platform such as Twitter is main stream which provides valuable user-generated information by publishing and sharing contents. Identifying interesting contents from large text-streams is a crucial issue in social media because many users struggle with information overload. Analyzing social audience who are interested in a company of social media is very difficult and so many text mining methods e.g. fuzzy keyword match method, Twitter LDA method and Machine learning approaches are used for solving this problem. Using the tweets of the account owner to segment followers and describing a group of high-value social audience members will assist the account owner to spend resources more effectively by sending offers to the appropriate audience which will lead to maximal marketing performance and more the return on contribution.

AB  - Customers' conversations on social media could shed light into their experience, opinions, feelings, and concerns. To gain valuable knowledge about customers, it becomes increasingly important for businesses to collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize user-generated data on social media. However, analyzing social media data is challenging due to the vast increase of social media data. In this paper, we present a workflow approach of using established natural language preprocessing, text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze social media data. Then we conducted two experiments to verify the effectiveness of our workflow approach by mining online movie reviews. The results show that our workflow approach is effective in analyzing social media data.

AB  - Traditional data mining usually deals with data from a single domain. In the big data era, we are facing a diversity of datasets from different sources in different domains. These datasets consist of multiple modalities, each of which has a different representation, distribution, scale and density. Big data have volumes in range Exabyte's ten to the power of eighteen. A large number of data's are stored in Big Data storage every second. For instance in YouTube for every second a video of size 72 hours are being uploaded. It shows that big data have a big scope in handling of large data. Big data for learning, intelligence, data fusion, social network, mining and so many plays a vital role in it. The big data technologies along with machine learning algorithm have developed lots of advanced development in the field of social mining, network and social Medias. It has also developed so many challenges in data storage, handling, representation, mining, analysing the user behaviours and so many. In Social mining along with text the symbols are also analysed for effective mining of users. This paper does not only introduce high-level principles of each category of methods, but also give examples in which these techniques are used to handle real big data problems. The data storage size can be optimized by using the map reduce algorithm in a effective way for data storage in big data. When the repeateddata's are replaced with its reference then the storage will be optimized. Thus this method implementation will leads to the effective data mining and the analysing of persons behaviour more effectively.

AB  - Popularity and usability of Social Media in today's scenario is universal. None of us can deny to the fact it is not only the source of communication or connection between friends but also has broaden its horizons to politics, television industry, source to advertisement for companies, education and many more[11][15]. Most of the companies or personalities are maintaining pages on these social media sites to interact with the users of these sites they are even posting messages, videos on these sites so that they can get attached by more and more users. Researches have shown even in latest 2014 elections that BJP used social media as its most liked option for promotion. The same was hit and liked by masses. Seeing this we can actually see the acceptance of 'Like' on the social media. It has become a measure to actually analyze and capture user interest on social media. It enables one to actually calculate and measure the user liking over certain objects. It gives the clear cut idea of user interest in a particular object and thus calculations can be made accordingly for sharing and promoting information or objects on social media sites [12]. We are trying to seek a model to analyze and mine the influence of 'Like' in social media. To calculate the effect on the object 'Like' mining algorithm is proposed along with the network model for social media. Facebook data is being used to show the influence and effect of the approach.

AB  - The explosive usage of social media produces massive amount of unlabeled and high-dimensional data. Feature selection has been proven to be effective in dealing with high-dimensional data for efficient learning and data mining. Unsupervised feature selection remains a challenging task due to the absence of label information based on which feature relevance is often assessed. The unique characteristics of social media data further complicate the already challenging problem of unsupervised feature selection, e.g., social media data is inherently linked, which makes invalid the independent and identically distributed assumption, bringing about new challenges to unsupervised feature selection algorithms. In this paper, we investigate a novel problem of feature selection for social media data in an unsupervised scenario. In particular, we analyze the differences between social media data and traditional attribute-value data, investigate how the relations extracted from linked data can be exploited to help select relevant features, and propose a novel unsupervised feature selection framework, LUFS, for linked social media data. We systematically design and conduct systemic experiments to evaluate the proposed framework on data sets from real-world social media Web sites. The empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of our proposed framework.

AB  - Nowadays, social media has grown very rapidly and has a growing number of users making it an attractive data source for analysis. A software that is able to collect data from social media, pre-process and analyze the data to generate knowledge and information as desired is required. Usually, the software is applicable only for a specific social media. The paper proposes an architecture for Social Media Data Analytics such that different softwares for analyzing different social media can be built based on it. The proposed architecture is adapted from Rahman's architecture that originally supports only for analyzing data from Facebook Different form Rahman's architecture, the proposed architecture contains of 4 blocks of new units, i.e. (1) Data Collection and Temporary Storage Unit, (2) Data and Text Pre-processing Unit, (3) Network Analysis and Data Mining Unit, and (4) Knowledge Representation Unit. The software architecture has meet three main aspects of architectural quality attributes conceptual integrity, correctness and completeness and buildability. Based on the architecture, a software has been built. The software developed by analyzing its functionalty for analyzing data from Facebook and Twitter. Thus the software is expanded such that it has functionality for analyzing data from Instagram. In order for that, we define 4 new classes (of 12 classes) extended from the original classes defined in the original software. It shows that the software built based on the proposed architecture can be extended form different type of social media with minimal effort. Using the factory method pattern, the software supports structural configurability and structural flexibility such that the extension can be done using minimal effort.

AB  - Recently, some efforts have been made to mine social media for the analysis of public sentiment. By means of a literature review on early works related to social media analytics especially on opinion mining, it was recognized that in the real life social media environment, the structure of the data is commonly not clear and it does not directly generate enough information to fully represent any selected target. However, most of these works were unable to accurately extract clear indications of general public opinion from the ambiguous social media data. They also lacked the capacity to summarize multi-characteristics from the scattered mass of social data and use it to compile useful models, also lacked any efficient mechanism for managing the big data. Motivated by these research problems, this paper proposes a novel matrix-based fuzzy algorithm, called the FMM system, to mine the defined multi-layered Twitter data. Through sets of comparable experiments applied on Twitter data, the proposed FMM system achieved an excellent performance, with both fast processing speeds and high predictive accuracy.

AB  - The small number of patients enrolled in clinical trials to test new drugs and the relatively short trial durations make it paramount to monitor drugs' effectiveness and risks after they are approved by the regulatory agency. A thorough evaluation of a drug's effectiveness, side effects, and social and economic influences can prevent serious health damage to the public and shed light on new drug discovery and development. Past research has examined spontaneous reporting systems and electronic health records systems as data sources to study medication outcomes. However, both data sources are not able to provide complete and unbiased pictures of patients' care, making it necessary to integrate new data sources, such as increasingly prevalent social media data. In this study, we compared and evaluated four social media sites, in terms of data coverage and quality using 11 disease-drug pairs of careful selection. We found some patients reported serendipitous new indications for the drugs they were using for comorbid conditions, which is truly valuable information for drug repositioning. We also identified five cases of informal use of English on social media that can be challenging for computers to process, including comparative sentiment, sarcasm, grammar errors, pronoun reference and semantic reference, and emoticons. Our study suggests that social media can be a complementary new data source for studying medication outcomes, and reliable natural language processing and text mining methods are needed to automatically mine social media data on a large scale.

AB  - The increasing influence of social media and enormous participation of users creates new opportunities to study human social behavior along with the capability to analyze large amount of data streams. One of the interesting problems is to distinguish between different kinds of users, for example users who are leaders and introduce new issues and discussions on social media. Furthermore, positive or negative attitudes can also be inferred from those discussions. Such problems require a formal interpretation of social media logs and unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once the social media data such as user messages are parsed and network relationships are identified, data mining techniques can be applied to group different types of communities. However, the appropriate granularity of user communities and their behavior is hardly captured by existing methods. In this paper, we present a framework for the novel task of detecting communities by clustering messages from large streams of social data. Our framework uses K-Means clustering algorithm along with Genetic algorithm and Optimized Cluster Distance (OCD) method to cluster data. The goal of our proposed framework is twofold that is to overcome the problem of general K-Means for choosing best initial centroids using Genetic algorithm, as well as to maximize the distance between clusters by pairwise clustering using OCD to get an accurate clusters. We used various cluster validation metrics to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. The analysis shows that the proposed method gives better clustering results and provides a novel use-case of grouping user communities based on their activities. Our approach is optimized and scalable for real-time clustering of social media data.

AB  - In recent years, different types of review systems have been developed with the recommender system (RS). RSs are developed based on user textual reviews, ratings, and comparative opinions. RSs for social media resources, such as blogs, forums, social network websites, social bookmarking websites, video portals, and chat portals help users to collaborate effectively. Social media resources are used in the RS for recommending contents, articles, news, e-commerce products, and users. Although research on social media in RSs has increased annually, comprehensive literature review and classification of these RS studies are limited and must, therefore, be improved. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the social media RS on research articles published from 2011 to 2015 by exploiting a methodological decision analysis in six aspects, including recommendation approaches, research domains, and data sets used in each domain, data mining techniques, recommendation type, and the use of performance measures. A total of 61 articles are reviewed among the initial 434 articles on RS research published in Web of Science and Scopus between 2011 and 2015. To accomplish the aim of this paper, a comprehensive review and analysis was performed on extracted articles to explore various recommendation approaches which are used in the RS. In addition, various social media domains are identified, where RSs have been employed. In each identified domain, publicly available data sets are also reported. Furthermore, various data mining techniques, recommendation types, and performance measures are also analyzed and reviewed in technical aspects. Finally, potential open research directions are also presented for future researchers intended to work in social media RS domain.

AB  - With the rapid development of Internet and information technology, social media has been growing fast. A large amount of social awareness data which represent the public's sensing and response to emerging technologies contained in social media, such as Twitter. By analyzing and mining the social awareness data to early detect the future trend of emerging technologies and identify the commercial potential of emerging technologies are crucial for government research and development strategic planning, social investment and enterprises practices. For this reason, this paper proposes a method to analyze the social awareness of emerging technologies based on Twitter data mining. Firstly, the natural language processing module in Thomson Data Analyzer is applied to extract the keywords from the tweets. Secondly, the social awareness information is analyzed by applying text mining and social network analysis, then, the social awareness of emerging technologies is mined by using time-slicing-based awareness information map. Finally, the perovskite solar cells technology is as a case study to analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.

AB  - Social Media allow people to communicate over long distance and increase the users for the past years. However the threat of Hoax is also increasing in social media which increase the risk of mass panic, where the society become confuse between false and true, other words between hoax and not hoax. To mitigate the effect of hoax, a system to filter out hoax posts from social media is proposed. We propose a system framework that might be able to filter out hoax from social media post feeds in order to reduce the amount of hoax posts in social media. It is difficult to reduce 100% hoax from social media, but at least there is a technology which can decrease the hoax in social media. This system works by utilizing data mining to search past hoax records and analyze the post data pattern to determine whether a post is a hoax or not hoax. Our proposed system will also utilize social media Application Program Interface (API) such as news, facebook, twitter, in order to find similar writing in other social media or news website to find out the authenticity of a person's post.

AB  - Industry and government organisations across the world increasingly use social media for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) activities that include communicating with customers about their services/products and distilling customer opinions for assessing their effectiveness. In this paper, we explore the exploitation of social media for CRM, and describe the development and functionality of VIZIE - a social media monitoring system designed to help media monitors to distill the perception of potential and actual customers of the value of existing products and services, identify and correct customer misinformation, discover how to better meeting customer expectations, and (if needed) communicate directly with the customers by using the customers' preferred social media forum. VIZIE monitors the most popular social media networks and mines their content in real time independently of topical domain and social media source/type. VIZIE achieves these by integrating information from multiple social media sources to create a broader, more complete context compared individual social media posting about specific topics of interest to a VIZIE user. VIZIE also provides the ability to automatically create overviews and summaries of any such topic, permits user queries, and supports drill down to individual social media posting. VIZIE accomplishes these by using a variety of natural language processing and information retrieval techniques that are specifically selected for (or tailored to deliver) real-time responsiveness. We provide an overview of the real-world requirements that informed the design of this system that has been used by more than twenty organisations and describe an overview of its architecture, the data analysis methods employed in its implementation, and their orchestration for achieving real-time response at an internet-wide big social data analysis scope.

AB  - A Data offers many facilities to the end users such as software, organization and platform go on. In this paper, we study about the wisely mining knowledge of social media. Social media becomes much popular from the health care information and Biomedical. This information is commonly shared so healthcare is improves and costs is decrease using opinion which is generated by user. We suggest investigation framework that give attentions on side effects of drugs and also focus on positive and negative response. To improve health care some Clinical documents are mostly useful because it's are free-text data sources. Clinical documents containing information related to symptoms and valuable medications. To extract a Data from large dataset it's become a very popular because users get various ideas from this filtered data. All Data Mining and Knowledge mining become popular because user are process on data and getting information of different area like health, Social, etc. After data processing we focus on users positive and negative opinions. We count this opinions and find out which medication is good, to decide this we also find out the side effects of the medications. Further we focus on the symptoms of the cancer patient. By taking the expert doctors suggestion, we list out the medication of the cancer according to the symptoms and we provide this medication or treatment to the user on our forum. We can expand our research into Data and Knowledge mining of social media and takes the users' views on various drugs of cancer. This daily updated data helps to pharmaceutical industry, doctors, hospitals, and medical staff, for effective future treatments.

AB  - The increasing popularity of social interactions and geotagged, user-generated content has transformed the television viewing experience from laid-back video watching behavior into a "lean-forward"' socially engaged experience. This article describes a multiscreen, social TV system integrated with social sense via a second screen as a novel paradigm for content consumption. This new application is built upon the authors' cloud-centric media platform, which provides on-demand virtual machines for content platform services, including media distribution, storage, and processing. The media platform is also integrated with a Big Data social platform that crawls and mines social data related to the media content. Specifically, this new social TV approach consists of three key subsystems: interactive TV, social sense, and multiscreen orchestration. Interactive TV implements a cloud-based, social TV system, offering rich social features; social sense discovers the geolocation-aware public perception and knowledge related to the media content; and multiscreen orchestration provides an intuitive and user-friendly human-computer interface to combine the two other subsystems, fusing the TV viewing experience with social perception. The authors have built a proof-of-concept demo over a private cloud at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. Feature verification and performance comparisons demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in transforming the TV viewing experience.

AB  - Social media is recognized as the important collaborations in today's information oriented society. Especially, after the global topics like a severe disaster (e.g. the East Japan Great Earthquake, Thailand floods etc.), people all over the world post their thoughts/opinions to social media and their behaviors are sometimes influenced by the discussions on social media. Therefore, we would like to read and understand the contents on the worldwide SNS. Exploring topics on the social media globally is useful to gain a rich insight into the global social contexts. This paper proposes a framework for language independent social media analysis platform to detect the global topics. Our framework targets various countries' social media and extracts keywords from messages written by different languages. Then the framework translates keywords from a local language to English, so that we can understand meanings of keywords. Since our framework is based on keywords and it can extract topics from keywords using data mining techniques, once keywords are extracted, it can be language-independent. In this paper, our proposed framework for language independent social media analysis platform is described with examples of Thai social media analysis results.

AB  - In modern social media, massive visual and textual data are collected and uploaded to social Web sites everyday. How to extract useful knowledge from such multiple modality data and organize it in an efficient way remains an important problem. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate joint visual and textual mining for social media data. My dissertation aims at contributing to our theoretical understanding on weakly supervised learning, as well as systematically building a visual and textual knowledgebase. This research focuses on three phases of investigation: 1) how textual data like tags help weakly supervised visual parsing, 2) how to build a large scale knowledge base by mapping visual and textual concepts on social media, 3) with such a knowledgebase, how can we interpret/organize social media data in a more reliable and effective way.

AB  - The amount and variety of multimedia data such as images, movies and music available on over social networks are increasing rapidly. However, the ability to analyze and exploit these unorganized multimedia data remains inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing techniques. Our finding in this paper is that the emerging social curation service is a promising information source for the automatic understanding and mining of images distributed and exchanged via social media. One remarkable virtue of social curation service datasets is that they are weakly supervised: the content in the service is manually collected, selected and maintained by users. This is very different from other social information sources, and we can utilize this characteristics for media content mining without expensive media processing techniques. In this paper we present a machine learning system for predicting view counts of images in social curation data as the first step to automatic image content evaluation. Our experiments confirm that the simple features extracted from a social curation corpus are much superior in terms of count prediction than the gold-standard image features of computer vision research.

AB  - Indonesian text data from social media is one of large text data that interesting to be mined. Mining the insight knowledge from large text data need more effort and time to processed. Moreover, Indonesian text data from social media contains natural language, including slang that require special treatment. We propose incremental technique for more efficient mining process of large text data with Set of Frequent Word Itemset (SFWI) representation that had been proven capable to keep the meaning of Indonesian text well. We compared Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm for not incremental mining and Compact Pattern Growth (CP-Tree) algorithm for incremental mining. The result of experiment with 3,200, 5,000, 110,000, and 239,496 text data form Twitter showed that the incremental technique capable to reduce time process and memory usage for mining Indonesian large text data. Incremental technique with CP-Tree could decrease time process and memory usage so that time process was about 1.66 times faster and 1.84 times more efficient for memory usage than with FP-Growth which was not incremental.

AB  - Social media is becoming a major and popular technological platform that allows users to express personal opinions toward the subjects with shared interests. Identifying the sentiments of these social media data can help users make informed decisions. Existing research mainly focus on developing algorithms by mining textual information in social media. However, none of them collectively consider the relationships among heterogeneous social entities. Since users interact with social brands in social platforms, their opinions on specific topics are inevitably dependent on many social effects such as user preference on topics, peer influence, user profile information, etc. In this paper, we present a systematic framework to identify sentiments by incorporating user social effects besides textual information. We apply distributed item-based collaborative filtering technique to estimate user preference. Our experiments, conducted on large datasets from current major social platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Amazon.com, and Flyertalk.com, demonstrate that incorporating those user social effects can significantly improve sentiment identification accuracy.

AB  - Social media site users are constantly uploading images onto social media platforms to document their lives for others. These users may be unaware, though, that the pictures they upload have metadata embedded within them. The metadata includes a wide variety of different types of information about the pictures and the camera used to take them, including Global Positioning System location data. After the picture is uploaded, data is collected by data mining companies that are allowed access to the data by social media sites. What these companies do with this data is uncertain and raises privacy concerns for users. This research provides insight into how much information is stored within pictures and how this may affect users' privacy. We have also supplied a programming example in the Python programming language that performs the removal of all the metadata, or just the Global Positioning System location data, from images before they are uploaded. Instead of completely stripping away the metadata, our solution allows the users to create identical copies of their images that are free of metadata. These images can now be uploaded free of information the user may not be comfortable sharing with data mining companies or other social media users.

AB  - Students' informal conversations on social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) shed light into their educational experiences-opinions, feelings, and concerns about the learning process. Data from such uninstrumented environments can provide valuable knowledge to inform student learning. Analyzing such data, however, can be challenging. The complexity of students' experiences reflected from social media content requires human interpretation. However, the growing scale of data demands automatic data analysis techniques. In this paper, we developed a workflow to integrate both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. We focused on engineering students' Twitter posts to understand issues and problems in their educational experiences. We first conducted a qualitative analysis on samples taken from about 25,000 tweets related to engineering students' college life. We found engineering students encounter problems such as heavy study load, lack of social engagement, and sleep deprivation. Based on these results, we implemented a multi-label classification algorithm to classify tweets reflecting students' problems. We then used the algorithm to train a detector of student problems from about 35,000 tweets streamed at the geo-location of Purdue University. This work, for the first time, presents a methodology and results that show how informal social media data can provide insights into students' experiences.

AB  - Social media sites are a major source for feedbacks, opinion, decision and other user-generated information on services products and ideas which help to mine human behavioral patterns and maps and measures formal and informal relationships between them. Blogs and social networks sites have recently become a valuable resource for mining sentiments, user opinion in fields as diverse as customer relationship management, targeted marketing, public opinion tracking and text filtering. If the user-generated information is extracted reliably from social media then it provides a positive impact on critical applications related to Health Informatics, including Bioinformatics, Image Informatics, Clinical Informatics, Public Health Informatics, safety, marketing etc. This survey discusses various data mining techniques, research issues, future trends used in mining diverse aspects of the social media over decades going from the historical techniques to the up-to-date techniques with a focus on those which are thought to have the most promise and applicability to future data mining, including a novel technique named multiscale community detection.

AB  - According to the problem that efficient datasets cannot be quickly obtained from social media big data of social networks in the process of focused mining and analysis. An effective selection method for clustering mining with spacetime large data is proposed. The effective selection method of clustering mining divides the spatiotemporal large data from the dimension of space, time or attribute. Then do exploratory spatial data analysis(ESDA) to the obtained subsets to get the datasets with the potential of clustering mining quickly. the proposed method is verified by using the Weibo check-in data in Wuhan which is between 2011 and 2015 to mine commercial hotspots. The experimental results show that the method can quickly and effectively excavate datasets from Weibo check-in data that can reflect the distribution of Wuhan business circle, and the excavate d datasets have the characteristics of high clustering, small volume, high precision. The effective selection method of clustering mining for spatiotemporal data can provide fast and effective methods and ideas for the process of crowd sourcing geographic data today.

AB  - The emergence of social media and the huge amount of data generated by them, has lead researchers to study the possibility of their exploitation in order to identify hidden knowledge. Thus, two areas are attracting more and more interest in the research community, the opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The research papers in this field are increasing rapidly. However, few survey papers have been published in this area. The rare survey papers that have been published focusing on a particular aspect (for example, the sentiment classification techniques, the challenges and application of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, etc.) and don't concern the research work proposed this last two years. We propose, in this paper, a study of 60 recent papers (60 % published between 2013 and 2015) treating the social media mining. We compare this work regarding to several criteria. Finally, we present a table summarizing all studied work. Due to the richness of social media opinions, emotions and sentiments. We focus in this paper on opinion mining and sentiment analysis and show the position of this field in social media mining issues. Then, we describe them in detail by studying the research work on each task in these issues. We will finish by identifying a set of open issues that we will try to propose contributions in our future work.

So far, not much research has been done to aid businesses to strategically align their social media posts with their organizational goals. In this paper, using the Higher Education Sector as our case study, we explore how valuable business insights can be derived from social media data and how the social media strategies can be aligned with business strategies to help universities gain a competitive edge. Using a social media editorial model for universities and text mining, we analyse the Facebook page of one university and describe the procedures and results. Our findings show that the social media posts have been focusing mainly on advertising and maintaining the reputation of the organization and thereby neglecting the other main business objectives.

AB  - In the recent years, we have witnessed social networks blossom. Social networking reshaped worldwide communication significantly increased the speed of news spread, and connected the world stronger than ever. Although social networking has been such a revolutionary invention for the society, and many researchers have turned towards social media to explore trending topics, mainstream media still remains as the origin of the majority of the news discussed in social networking sites. Social stream mining to make video recommendations based on the trending topics has been an active direction in the research community. Understanding the trending topics and its impact on video sharing sites is very interesting for network traffic engineers. Quality of service can be significantly improved if we can predict what kind of video content will generate large traffic. The focus of this paper is to study which type of media, mainstream or social, can contribute better towards identifying trending topics. We present the experimental study of the story development process in mainstream and social media based on the real-world data. The study helps us properly identify which media source is more appropriate for the video recommendation and network traffic prediction systems. Through our findings, we discovered mainstream media could significantly improve the trend detection.

AB  - The explosive increasing of the social media data on the Web has created and promoted the development of the social media big data mining area welcomed by researchers from both academia and industry. The sentiment computing of news event is a significant component of the social media big data. It has also attracted a lot of researches, which could support many real-world applications, such as public opinion monitoring for governments and news recommendation for Websites. However, existing sentiment computing methods are mainly based on the standard emotion thesaurus or supervised methods, which are not scalable to the social media big data. Therefore, we propose an innovative method to do the sentiment computing for news events. More specially, based on the social media data (i.e., words and emoticons) of a news event, a word emotion association network (WEAN) is built to jointly express its semantic and emotion, which lays the foundation for the news event sentiment computation. Based on WEAN, a word emotion computation algorithm is proposed to obtain the initial words emotion, which are further refined through the standard emotion thesaurus. With the words emotion in hand, we can compute every sentence's sentiment. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method on the emotion computing for news events.

AB  - Social media platforms facilitate the emergence of citizen communities that discuss real-world events. Their content reflects a variety of intent ranging from social good (e.g., volunteering to help) to commercial interest (e.g., criticizing product features). Hence, mining intent from social data can aid in filtering social media to support organizations, such as an emergency management unit for resource planning. However, effective intent mining is inherently challenging due to ambiguity in interpretation, and sparsity of relevant behaviors in social data. In this paper, we address the problem of multiclass classification of intent with a use-case of social data generated during crisis events. Our novel method exploits a hybrid feature representation created by combining top-down processing using knowledge-guided patterns with bottom-up processing using a bag-of-tokens model. We employ pattern-set creation from a variety of knowledge sources including psycholinguistics to tackle the ambiguity challenge, social behavior about conversations to enrich context, and contrast patterns to tackle the sparsity challenge. Our results show a significant absolute gain up to 7% in the F1 score relative to a baseline using bottom-up processing alone, within the popular multiclass frameworks of One-vs-One and One-vs-All. Intent mining can help design efficient cooperative information systems between citizens and organizations for serving organizational information needs.

AB  - A rumor is commonly defined as a statement whose true value is unverifiable. As rumor can spread misinformation around people, causing social problems such as panic, and the rapid growth of online social media has made it possible for rumors to spread more quickly, it is important to automatically identify rumors for social media. Existing methods on rumor detection always concentrate on telling rumor from truth with handcrafted regular expressions, dealing with out of date rumor related message. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel hot topic detection method combining bursty term identification and multi-dimension sentence modeling to automatically detect emerging hot topics for rumor identification. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on two data sets from real-world social media. Experiment results show that our emerging rumor identification for social media with hot topic detection work well both in news data set and twitter data set, and combining the hot topic detection with the rumor detection is possible to finish real-time rumor identification. We believe our method to automatically detect rumor will open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of social media mining.

AB  - Social networking portals serve as an ideal platform for a person or an organization, to accomplish self-presentation and self-enhancement goals there by to understand their social relevance and hence, there have been many studies attempting to identify the relationship between different aspects of social media articles. Machine learning methods play a critical role in social media data analytics. This study evaluates the efficiency of predictive analytics with social media data of a private healthcare institution using classification and clustering algorithms. In this study, we also investigated the influence of system specific feature set and user generated features of social media articles to identify relevant data mining algorithms that are suitable for identifying knowledge-related patterns in dataset. Among the classification methods it is found that Bayesian algorithm performs better compared to other classification techniques. K-Means and Filtered cluster among the clustering techniques have better predictive analytics efficiency compared to other algorithms. Identifying the predictive analytics efficacy of these algorithms helps healthcare institution to build a model with most appropriate characteristics of social media articles.

AB  - Socialization refers to the lifelong process of inheriting and disseminating norms, customs and ideologies, providing an individual with the skills and habits necessary for participating within his or her own society. The process of socialization is operative not only in childhood but throughout life. Traditional agents of socialization include family, age mates, teachers and mass media. But now-a-days, in a world dominated by technology, social media also play a vital role in socialization. Social media drastically change the Internet and public relations landscape for everyone with Internet-access and a desire to friend, tweet and update a status. Billions of people are now creating and sharing massive amounts of data with one another. Disappearing barriers with a view to producing information and interacting with other people, social media have started the Social Data Revolution. These data too contain in capsule form, the premise of our culture, its attitudes and ideologies. The words are always written by someone and these people too join the teachers, the peers, the parents in the socialization process. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media in socialization process by mining the social web.

AB  - The advent of Web 2.0 and social media content has stirred much excitement and created abundant opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general public and consumers toward social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences. Many new and exciting social, geopolitical, and business-related research questions can be answered by analyzing the thousands, even millions, of comments and responses expressed in various blogs (such as the blogosphere), forums (such as Yahoo Forums), social media and social network sites (including YouTube, Facebook, and Flikr), virtual worlds (such as Second Life), and tweets (Twitter). Opinion mining, a subdiscipline within data mining and computational linguistics, refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classifying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in various online news sources, social media comments, and other user-generated content. Sentiment analysis is often used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjectivity, and other emotional states in online text.

AB  - In recent years, users are widely intend to express and share their opinions over the Internet. However, due to the characters of social media, it appears negative use of social media. Cyberbullying is one of the abuse behavior in the Internet as well as a very serious social problem. Under this background and motivation, it can help to prevent the happen of cyberbullying if we can develop relevant techniques to discover cyberbullying in social media. Thus, in this paper we propose an approach based on social networks analysis and data mining for cyberbullying detection. In the approach, there are three main techniques for cyberbullying discovery will be studied, including keyword matching technique, opinion mining and social network analysis. In addition to the approach, we will also discuss the experimental design for the evaluation of the performance.

AB  - The TV experience is being transformed with online social networks. TV audiences are sharing their opinions (i.e., social response) about video programs on OSNs (e.g., Twitter and Sina Weibo), thus providing a great opportunity for mining these data for stakeholders in TV value chains. This new paradigm is touted as social TV analytics, integrating the emerging big data research into TV. In this article, we envision and develop a unified big data platform for social TV analytics, extracting valuable insights from TV social response in a real-time manner. Such a platform presents tremendous challenges in networking architecture for our big data platform. We propose to build a cloud-centric platform with SDN support, providing on-demand virtual machines and reconfigurable networks. The architecture of our system consists of three key components, including a robust data crawler system, an SDN-enabled big data processing system, and a social media analytics system. The data crawler system adopts a distributed architecture to circumvent the access constraints of OSNs to crawl sufficient data about each TV program of interest; the SDN-enabled big data processing system integrates SDN and Hadoop, and exploits the SDN benefit to transfer intermediate data between different processing units to accelerate the data processing rate; and the social media analytics system extracts the public perception and knowledge related to TV programs based on microblog data. We have built a proof-of-concept demo over a private cloud at Nanyang Technological University. Feature verification and performance comparisons demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the system.

AB  - Online Social Media (OSM) platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, are part of everyday life as powerful communication tools. They let users communicate anywhere anytime, and improve their own public image. For this reason, OSM are becoming more and more popular. Social Media data may play a crucial role in various decision-making processes. In this setting, research topics connected to monitoring of Social Media data are becoming increasingly important. The presented work is grounded on direct extensive experiences in data collection from different Social Media sources, and on the different methodologies applied in different reference domains (namely Online Reputation, Social Media Intelligence, and Opinion Mining in tourism). The crawlers developed for these domains provide valuable suggestions to elicit diverse requirements. After lessons learned in such fields, a general architecture for data capture from Social Media sources has been devised, and the interfaces of the composing modules have been defined. The resulting API can be exploited for an orderly re-engineering of crawling tools in the reference domains, thus implementing specific versions of the generic architecture.

AB  - The use of alternative data in financial applications has gained momentum in recent years with the increased availability of data along with computational resources. While traditional financial pricing theory supports an efficient market hypothesis, recent research has shown that data mining of exogenous feeds can provide further information to inform market activity. Social media has become an increasingly important source of this information due to its abundant, directed, and realtime nature. However, little is known about what combination of social media and financial features is indicative of market activity. In this work, we investigate what combination of social media and financial features are present when social media data is effective for reducing uncertainty about future stock volatility. Moreover, identification of feature profiles from clusters of stocks indicates that sentiment polarity (i.e. positive or negative) taken alone is not enough to infer future volatility, instead a balance of bullish and bearish signals are preferred even above commonly identified features in the literature such as message volume and market cap. This is important because by combining bullish and bearish sentiment and a range of other social and financial variables we are able to generate a time series which is more informative about volatility than any of the individual feature time series. Robustness of these findings is verified across 500 stocks from both NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges. Reported results are reproducible via an open source library for social-financial analysis made freely available.

Social multimedia mining employs data mining techniques to understand the association among content, user and interaction in social multimedia. It has three basic problems at basis, micro and macro association levels. This paper extends the current interpretation of social multimedia mining as processing multi-modal individual objects, to a generalized definition beyond modality and beyond object. Cross-OSN (Online Social Networking) data mining, an instantiation to general social multimedia mining, is then positioned with main challenges, review of current studies and future directions.

AB  - Tremendous amount of data is getting explored through IOT (Internet of Things) from variety of sources such as sensor network, social media feed, internet applications, called as Big Data. Big Data cannot be handled by conventional tools and techniques. Social networks are becoming dominant in communications over internet. The Big Data mining is essential in order to extract value from massive amount of data which could give better insights using efficient techniques. Association Rule mining and frequent itemset mining are popular techniques for data mining which needs entire dataset into main memory for processing, but large datasets do not fit into main memory. To overcome this limitation MapReduce is used for parallel processing of Big Data having features such as high scalability and robustness which helps to handle problem of large datasets. Proposed novel method, ClustBigFIM works on MapReduce framework for mining large datasets; ClustBigFIM is modified BigFIM algorithm providing scalability and speed in order to extract meaningful information from large datasets in the form of associations, emerging patterns, sequential patterns, correlations and other significant data mining tasks which gives better insight to make effective business decisions in competitive environment using faster and efficient parallel processing platform.

AB  - Some recent studies have suggested that public opinions expressed in social media may be correlated with various social issues. To find out what actually can be discovered in social media data, we need data mining. Data mining approaches that can handle massive amount of data have recently been referred to as big data algorithms. In this paper, we propose a big data algorithm to handling Twitter data mining. Furthermore, to ensure scalability, MapReduce framework is adopted to parallelize the proposed algorithm. Through the experiments, the potential of the proposed algorithm can be demonstrated. Computationally, the speed of execution can be shown to increase significantly despite increases in data set size. In fact, the acceleration ratio increases as the size of the dataset increases, and as the number of Data Nodes increases.

We examined Facebook activities of 98 students, consisting of the groups of class of 4/1, 4/3 and 5/1 of Sa school located in Nan province, Thailand, during the first semester of 2011. We applied both statistics and data mining techniques for data analysis to determine the effects of Facebook usages for education on students' learning skills. Statistics was used to evaluate the correlation between students' Facebook usage and grade point averages, and a data mining technique was used to learn association rules from data. This project has helped us learn the effects of using social media web applications (i.e., Facebook applications) for education on student-learning performance. We found that examining the ratio of number of Facebook posts and comments for educational purposes to the one for non-educational purposes could help us draw a conclusion that Facebook usage does have an impact on students' learning performances. Specifically, we found that students who spent more time on education-related posting and commenting earned better grades than the ones who did the opposite. Furthermore, as we have to group data to change numerical data to nominal data, we found that data grouping play an important role on the number of rules and their associated confidence values. Too loose and too tight data grouping might be the reason the Association Rule algorithm derives few rules with high confidence values. We hope the results can help learners and teachers realize the advantages, disadvantages and effects of using social media web application for education.

AB  - Given the ubiquity of social media, we capitalized on interest-based relevance as a key component to enhance user experience. Interest-based relevance modeling was extracted from user interaction in a cross-platform social media Big Data repository. The goal of this study was twofold: first we addressed theoretical dilemmas of a cross-platform user experience; second, we implemented an android-based mobile application and designed a cloud architecture to account for theoretical parameters of Big Data User-centric approach and interactivity. To address cross-platform Big Data challenges, we relied on cloud computing to perform computationally intensive operations such as searching, data mining, and data processing at large scale. Our use case was based on a cross-platform interest-based navigation and content filtering across multiple radio content streams. The streams consisted of tags from radio stations' programming and social media content through a discovery process. User interaction was geared to enable preferred topic filtering, flexibly shifting participation roles, notifications, and navigation through external data sources. We tested our application on a list of popular radio stations and their social media content streams (including Facebook, Twitter, Google+) to generate a Big Data scenario. Even if diverse and nature, data stream traffic generated through a mobile application KASU has proven to be a robust Big Data source with a list of ad hoc user-centric applications.

AB  - Web 2.0 technologies have brought new ways of connecting people in social networks for collaboration in various on-line communities. Social Computing is a novel and emerging computing paradigm that involves a multi-disciplinary approach in analyzing and modeling social behaviors on different media and platforms to produce intelligent and interactive applications and results. In this paper, we give a brief survey of the various machine learning and computational techniques used in Social Computing by first examining the social platforms, e.g., social network sites, social media, social games, social bookmarking, and social knowledge sites, where computational methodology is required to collect, extract, process, mine, and visualize the data. We then present surveys on more specific instances of computation tasks and techniques, e.g., social network analysis, link modeling and mining, ranking, sentiment analysis, etc., that are being used on these social platforms to obtain desirable results. Lastly, we present a small subset of an extensive reference list, which contains over 140 highly relevant references relating to the recent development in the computational aspects of Social Computing.

AB  - In general, opinion mining has been used to know about what people think and feel about their products and services in social media platforms. Millions of users share opinions on different aspects of life every day. Spurred by that growth, companies and media organizations are increasingly seeking way to mine information. It requires efficient techniques to collect a large amount of social media data and extract meaningful information from them. This paper aims to provide an interactive automatic system which predicts the sentiment of the review/tweets of the people posted in social media using hadoop, which can process the huge amount of data.Till now, there are few different problems predominating in this research community, namely, sentiment classification, feature based classification and handling negations. A precise method is used for predicting sentiment polarity, which helps to improve marketing strategies. This paper deals with the challenges that appear in the process of Sentiment Analysis, real time tweets are considered as they are rich sources of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. This paper focus on Sentiment analysis,Feature based Sentiment classification and Opinion Summarization. The main objective of this paper is to perform real time sentimental analysis on the tweets that are extracted from the twitter and provide time based analytics to the user.

AB  - As the rapid development of social media, social community structure mining has become a popular research field in recent years. But traditional social community mining methods are not able to effectively deal with the data of large scale networks. We firstly introduce an information compression based community mining model in this paper, and with the help of the model, we transform the community mining problem into optimal information coding problem. And then propose a parallel computing method CInfoMR based on the MapReduce parallel framework to mine the social community structure. In the InfoMR, map tasks are responsible for splitting network data into a plenty of subsets, each reduce task is responsible for accomplishing community clustering by means of loop iteration on its subset, and finally all the results from the reduce phase are merged together to output. Theoretical analysis and related experiments verify the validity of the work in this paper. The results of the accuracy experiments show that, the accuracy of the InfoMR is much higher than that of Fast GN and PDST algorithm. The performance experiments on 2 real dataset and 2 simulative dataset show that InfoMR is able to accomplish the task of mining social community in a relatively short period of time on big data social networks.

AB  - The extensive use of social media has tremendous impact on culture, business, and politics on the world at large with potentially positive and negative effects. For example, social media coverage of crisis events may be used by authorities for effective disaster management or by malicious entities to spread rumors and fake news for financial or political benefit. Considering the harmful consequences of fake news in social media, there is a profound need to detect false information, control and/or prevent it from spreading. In this paper, we propose an advanced framework to identify tweets with fake news contents using techniques including statistical analysis of Twitter user account, reverse image searching, cross verification of fake news sources, and data mining. Experimental results on a large miscellaneous events dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in identifying fake tweets.

AB  - Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis are active research trends in natural language processing and data mining. Recently, this research has been extended outside the computer science area to cover other areas such as social science, political science, and business. The explosion of social media such as social networks, Blogs, Twitter, and forums has created unprecedented opportunities for data mining research community. Analyzers can study and analyze users' opinions, attitudes, and emotions about news or social events. Big data focuses on the intelligent analysis of a large amount of data that is typically collected from several different sources. Our focus in this work is to address new challenges raised by combining Apache Hadoop as a big data platform with an opinion mining approach to make a decision we often seek based on collected data from the opinions of people. We presented a case study about MERS virus in KSA to evaluate our proposed approach. A discussion of available dataset and results are also provided.

AB  - As data is growing rapidly day by day due to wide usage of social media, this social data will help business analyst as well as researchers to get the feedback about any service or product. Analysis of social media data can be used for many purposes like friend recommendation, product or service recommendation etc. There is need of such algorithms which will classify data accurately and will provide analysis results accurately. Also these algorithms need to scale rapidly with data sets. In this paper, Different phases of social media data mining are identified. We have studied algorithms whose training time remains same though the data size increases. We have implemented decision tree algorithm and compared it with other machine learning algorithms like NaiveBayes, Adaboost etc. It is found that decision tree algorithms gives accurate results as compared to other algorithms. In addition to that, out of different decision tree algorithms random decision tree (RDT) algorithm performs best than other decision tree algorithms like C4.5 or ID3.

AB  - Off-label drug use is an important healthcare topic as it is quite common and sometimes inevitable in medical practice. Though gaining information about off-label drug uses could benefit a lot of healthcare stakeholders such as patients, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, there is no such data repository of such information available. There is a desire for a systematic approach to detect off-label drug uses. Other than using data sources such as EHR and clinical notes that are provided by healthcare providers, we exploited social media data especially online health community (OHC) data to detect the off-label drug uses, with consideration of the increasing social media users and the large volume of valuable and timely user-generated contents. We adopted tensor decomposition technique, CP decomposition in this work, to deal with the sparsity and missing data problem in social media data. On the basis of tensor decomposition results, we used two approaches to identify off-label drug use candidates: (1) one is via ranking the CP decomposition resulting components, (2) the other one is applying a heterogeneous network mining method, proposed in our previous work [9], on the reconstructed dataset by CP decomposition. The first approach identified a number of significant off-label use candidates, for which we were able to conduct case studies and found medical explanations for 7 out of 12 identified off-label use candidates. The second approach achieved better performance than the previous method [9] by improving the F1-score by 3%. It demonstrated the effectiveness of performing tensor decomposition on social media data for detecting off-label drug use.

AB  - The World Wide Web has evolved very drastically and the recent advent in social networking and media rich websites has necessitated analysis of the social networks and opinions expressed by various users in media like blogs, tweets, and website pages alike. While a lot of previous researches have been done on product / CRM domain, relatively few research has been done on the network analysis of social media with a focus on extraction and opinion of e-Health data i.e. data expressed in various blogs or website pages by users regarding various aspects of their health. While marketing and medical companies can leverage this data to augment customer reach and thus further their profits, sentiment analysis and network analysis on the data can help various organizations understand health patterns, address people's concerns or predict outbreak patterns in case of contagious diseases. This paper outlines the machine learning techniques which are helpful in the analysis of medical domain data from Social networks. In this paper we compare the existing techniques of machine learning, discuss the advantages and challenges encompassing the perspectives involving the use of text mining methods for applications in E-health and medicine. We evaluate medical domain data classification efficiency using various metrics like ROC, AUC implemented via R language packages. We need to infer which machine learning technique is more relevant for processing data from social networks having medical terms in it.

AB  - Social networks are platforms where millions of users interact frequently and share variety of digital content with each other. Users express their feelings and opinions on every topic of interest. These opinions carry import value for personal, academic and commercial applications, but the volume and the speed at which these are produced make it a challenging task for researchers and the underlying technologies to provide useful insights to such data. We attempt to extend the established OLAP(On-line Analytical Processing) technology to allow multidimensional analysis of social media data by integrating text and opinion mining methods into the data warehousing system and by exploiting various knowledge discovery techniques to deal with semi-structured and unstructured data from social media. The capabilities of OLAP are extended by semantic enrichment of the underlying dataset to discover new measures and dimensions for building data cubes and by supporting up-to-date analysis of the evolving as well as the historical social media data. The benefits of such an analysis platform are demonstrated by building a data warehouse for a social network of Twitter, dynamically enriching the underlying dataset and enabling multidimensional analysis.

AB  - User-generated content on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook provides opportunity for researchers in various fields to understand human behaviors and social phenomena. On the one hand, these human behaviors and social phenomena are very complex in nature thus require in-depth qualitative analysis. On the other, the magnitude of social media data requires large-scale data analysis techniques. In this paper, we propose a web-based tool named SWAB (Social Web Analysis Buddy) that integrates both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. Specifically, this tool supports asynchronous collaboration among researchers conducting inductive content analysis on textural data from users' online posts and conversations. It then aggregates the results and calculates the agreement among researchers, and builds modeling algorithms based on the qualitative results to classify large-scale social media text content. This current paper focuses on the overall workflow and user interface design of this tool. We demonstrate the prototype of this tool by analyzing student-posted content on Twitter.

AB  - In current scenario, Social media websites provide great action for students to share joy and struggle, event emotion and stress, and seek social support. On various social media sites, students discuss and share their everyday experience in an informal and casual manner. Student's digital footprints provide vast amount of implicit knowledge and a whole new perspective for educational researchers and practitioners to understand student's experiences outside the controlled classroom environment. This understanding can inform institutional decision-making on interventions for at-risk students, improvement of education quality, and thus enhance student recruitment, retention, and success. Twitter is one such popular social media, whose data is highly informative. It presents a Challenge for analysis because of its humongous and disordered nature. In this paper, colleges are been ranked based on single feature, multiple feature and no feature, using two data mining algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Polarity Algorithm.

AB  - Social media has recently become as a powerful weapon people use for online discourse, creating content, share it and network with other individuals at a phenomenal frequency. With social media and user-generated content exploding the web/blogs/social networking forums, vendors/critiques/socialist and influential individuals got enthusiastic to mine this substantial data set for obvious meaning, but they soon discovered a novel challenge: to know that someone is talking about a particular topic/service/brand or social event is far less important in comparison to know how they are feeling and conversing about it. This is known as sentiment analysis or opinion mining. Numbers divulge that people are extensively using social media, expressing their positive opinions or negative apprehensions online. As an aftermath the concept of sentiment analysis/opinion mining is broadly being acknowledged and employed by society as a whole to enhance their business/products/services or just to assess the overall prevailing environment. Acknowledged work is being done in this area converging towards exploring sentiment analysis, its definite requirement in this era, different frameworks for sentiment analysis and their comparison with other previously proposed techniques, but unfortunately Urdu language is not considered comprehensively in this context. As Urdu is one of the prevalent languages, this paper aims at creating an application for sentiment analysis of Urdu comments on various websites. Elaborated system architecture is discussed in detail with techniques employed; experimentation procedure and proven results of 66% accuracy are also deliberated. The F-measure achieved by this proposed system is 0.73. Challenges faced in sentiment analysis with respect to this neglected language are also highlighted for future considerations.

AB  - Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis is an important Computer Science topic, that allows the discovery of the web user's attitude on one or more topics. Marketing, Social Engineering and Information Retrieval are achieved through the application of Opinion Mining on Web Data. Today Social Networks represent one of the most important places on the web for sharing information, media and opinions (26% of people have accounts on Social Networks). Integration with the opinions on social networks and social communities can improve the relevancy and quality of Opinion Mining Tools. This paper discusses how Social Networks Mining represents one of the most important tasks for Opinion Mining Systems, considering the state of art literature. Then, we will show an interesting approach based on ADJECTIVES (A), INTENSIFIERS (I) and NEGATIONS (N) (called AIN) developed for Italian. This approach is based on the use of an Italian Sentiment Thesaurus (AIN Thesaurus), developed by the authors and presented in this work.

AB  - Twitter is the most popular microblogging and social media services used by millions of Web users worldwide to read and write short messages about the topic related to their current status. Such social media sites usually has lots of irrelevant, unwanted and also huge information to carry out the study of human behaviour, new trends and so on. Highly influential, popular persons and public users tweet their status that are retweeted or replied by set of the audiences those view the tweets. By applying Sentiment analysis on the tweets made by the popular users and the audiences, we can discover whether the audiences are in favour to the views expressed. This work focuses on mining the information posted on twitter site about unemployment using hash tags. The proposed system is implemented using R language which makes it easy to mine data from Twitter with its support for twitter mining through wide range of APIs available. Mined twitter data is written into CSV files as the input dataset. Sentiment analysis is performed on the input dataset that initially performs data cleaning by removing the stop words, followed by classifying the tweets as positive and negative by matching with the positive-word and negative-word text dictionary to assigns the scores for every tweet. Next, Text mining is performed on the related hash-tags to generate the word cloud. Finally the analysis of the unemployment rate is performed on the individual hash tags and the merged hash tags based on the scores recorded for every tweets during the Sentiment analysis stage.

AB  - Big Data is a new label given to a diverse field of data intensive informatics in which the datasets are so large that they become hard to work with effectively. The term has been mainly used in two contexts, firstly as a technological challenge when dealing with dataintensive domains such as high energy physics, astronomy or internet search, and secondly as a sociological problem when data about us is collected and mined by companies such as Facebook, Google, mobile phone companies, retail chains and governments. In this paper we look at this second issue from a new perspective, namely how can the user gain awareness of the personally relevant part Big Data that is publicly available in the social web. The amount of user-generated media uploaded to the web is expanding rapidly and it is beyond the capabilities of any human to sift through it all to see which media impacts our privacy. Based on an analysis of social media in Flickr, Locr, Facebook and Google+, we discuss privacy implications and potential of the emerging trend of geo-tagged social media. We then present a concept with which users can stay informed about which parts of the social Big Data deluge is relevant to them.

AB  - With the development of social networks, people can easily share their feelings and express their opinions on interesting topics. Thus, social media mining is becoming an important research topic. However, huge volume of social Web data in various forms are rapidly generated around the world in a much faster speed than those of any other media. This can lead to the difficulties in social data analysis: noisy data and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a distributed data analytics platform for social media. First, data from various sources are collected and stored in a distributed index for efficient retrieval. Then, a distributed analytics framework is built from memory-based cluster computing based on the MapReduce paradigm. Finally, statistical analysis is performed and integrated for presentation. In the experiment, we built the platform by open source projects Hadoop and Spark, and implemented combinations of map and reduce operations. We compared the efficiency and scalability of the platform on various check-in datasets. Further evaluation is needed to verify the performance in different types of operations.

AB  - The use of tattoos as a soft biometric is increasing in popularity among law enforcement communities. There is great need for large scale, publicly available tattoo datasets that can be used to standardize efforts to develop tattoo-based biometric systems. In this work, we introduce a large tattoo dataset (WVU-MediaTatt) collected from a social-media website. Additionally, we provide the source links to the images so that anyone can re-generate this dataset. Our WVU-MediaTatt database contains tattoo sample images from over 1,000 subjects, with two tattoo image samples per subject. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is significantly bigger than any current released publicly available tattoo dataset, including the recently released NIST Tatt-C dataset. The use of social media in deep learning, data mining, and biometrics has traditionally been a controversial issue in terms of data security and protection of privacy. In this work, we first conduct a full discussion on the issues associated with data collection from social media sources for the use of biometric system development, and provide a framework for data collection. In this study, within the process of creating a new large scale tattoo dataset, we consider the issues and make attempts protect the subject's privacy and information, while ensuring that subjects remain in control of their data in this study and the use of the data adheres to the guidelines proposed by the Heath Care Compliance Association (HCCA) and the U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services.

AB  - Motivation is fundamental for students to achieve successful and complete learning. Motivation can be extrinsic, i.e., driven by external rewards, or intrinsic, i.e., driven by internal factors. Intrinsic motivation is the most effective and must be inspired by the task at hand. Here, a novel strategy is presented to increase intrinsic motivation toward activities requiring the use of sample data sets, by automatically extracting the student's social data from a social media network, to create a personalized sample data set. A tool was developed to access Facebook and create a database to be used in practical assignments on database queries. A user study (N = 74) measured intrinsic motivation before and after the assignment in three different groups of first-year university students. Each group had to create a set of queries of similar difficulty, with each group using a different database. Intrinsic motivation was found to be significantly higher for the group using their own social media data than for the groups using social media data from an unknown person or a business. The approach presented here can be applied to other subjects, such as data mining, image processing, or statistics.

AB  - Social media and Web 2.0 have enabled internet users to contribute online content, which may be crawled and utilized for a variety of reasons, from personalized advertising to behaviour prediction/profiling. One negative case scenario is the political affiliation profiling. Our hypothesis is that this scenario is nowadays realistic, applicable to social media, and violates civil rights, privacy and freedom. To demonstrate this, we developed a horror story, i.e., a Panopticon method, in order to reveal this threat and contribute in raising the social awareness over it. The Panopticon relies on data/opinion mining techniques; hence it classifies comments, videos and playlists, collected from the popular social medium YouTube. Afterwards, it aggregates these classifications in order to decide over the users' political affiliation. The experimental test case of the Panopticon is an extensive Greek community of YouTube users. In order to demonstrate our case, we performed an extensive graph theoretical and content analysis of the collected dataset and show how and what kind of personal data (e.g. political attitude) can be derived via data mining on publicly available YouTube data. Then, we provide the reader with an analysis of the legal means that are available today, to a citizen or a society as a whole, so as to effectively be prevented from such a threat.

AB  - Mining social media data to obtain traffic relevant information is an emerging topic due to the real-time and ubiquitous features of social media. In this paper, we focus on a specific issue in social media mining that concerns to extract traffic relevant microblogs from the Sina Weibo platform, which is the first and essential step to further extract detailed traffic information, such as the location of a traffic incident. It is transformed into a machine learning problem of short text classification. We employ deep neural networks to classify microblogs into traffic relevant and traffic irrelevant ones. More specifically, we firstly adopt the continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) model to learn word embedding representations based on the dataset of three billion unlabeled microblogs. Next we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the abstract features of traffic relevant and traffic irrelevant microblogs. The key advances in this paper are: use of semantics of words and deployment of deep neural networks to extract traffic information from social media text. Experiments show that the proposed deep learning method has superior performance over support vector machine (SVM) based method and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method.

While dealing with big data it's difficult for traditional databases and architecture to modify, grill and then structure this data, it can lead to many consumer insights which can help to create win-win situations. It has become necessary to find out value from large data sets to show relationships, dependencies as well as to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors. Big Data has been characterized by 5 Vs - Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value. This paper deals with all these 5Vs, features, challenges, future of Big Data in social media arena using data mining algorithms, tools and Hadoop framework for overcoming challenges of Big Data.

AB  - Public libraries are increasingly using social media to connect their users in an innovative way. Librarians make use of social media with the purpose of "being part of their communities", or promoting libraries' services and events. Social media has become a significant platform for libraries to create their own participatory services emphasizing engagement with users. However, there has been little empirical investigation into the success of social media use by libraries. In this paper, we study the role of a recently popular social media, Twitter, in engaging users with a focus on public libraries. We use topic-modeling techniques to classify the library user engagement strategies into four categories -- literature exhibits, engaging topic, community building, and library showcasing. These four engagement strategies are re-examined with the tweets collected from ten public libraries over three months. The tweets topic distribution of every library is discussed in the paper. Finally, the impacts of every strategy on user engagement have been evaluated by users feedback on every tweet. Through the data mining of public libraries' tweets, we aim to explore how user engagement strategies are used by the libraries on Twitter and suggest the best practices for libraries on social media initiatives to engage their users effectively.

AB  - Currently, social media are commonly used by business organizations to get many advantages. Through social media, business gets feedback from their customer by giving them a room for sharing opinion or comment. This kind of customer engagement became a tool of marketing and promotion. This research proposes investigating the customer engagement by analysis the comments on social media (Facebook and Twitter) in transport online. This study investigates by mining the comments of fan page Facebook and tweet of Twitter in three transports online in Indonesia; Gojek, Grab, and Uber using the API service which is provided both of social media. The data comments are classified into some categories, positive, negative, and neutral sentiment using TF-IDF. The result shows that the category "Feedback system by driver" and "Feedback system by user" have the most comments for three means of transports online, while category "Service quality for driver" has the smallest comments. The study also reveals that the most comments are complaining. This feedback of social media can be used to evaluate the performance of these business transport online.

AB  - The rapid growth of internet user and the popularity of social media network has changed how people interact and doing everyday activities. Indonesia Small Medium Enterprise Organizations, such as the retail industry has also started to uses various social media to market their product online. The rapid growth of internet user and the popularity of social media network has led to big data of online opinion. Analysis on these opinions is very important because it can extract knowledge that can be the basis in making business decisions for the organizations. The problem is Indonesian citizen communicate in Bahasa and local languages, not to mention slang languages. So to build a sentiment analysis system is not easy because it has to be able to identify words and classify its sentiment. To overcome this problem, a sentiment analysis system that able to process opinions from social media using text mining is developed. This proposed approach would use feature extraction and selection to select words from learning dataset of Indonesian corpus and then classifying them to the respective class of target objects and sentiment. Then, we adopt the Naïve Bayes Classifier technique, with 3 sentiment classifications, aspects of online retail shop, and polarity of sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) and the polarity of the aspects of online retail shop. Results from this study shows that the sentiment analysis system for clothing product on social media using Naïve Bayes Classifier method is able to classify user opinions with 97.25% precision, 89.83% recall, and 89.21% accuracy.

AB  - Data Mining algorithms and machine learning techniques form a key part of the majority of computing applications today. They are becoming an inherent part of business decision processes, e-commerce, social networking and social media applications as well as commercial and scientific computing applications. It is becoming increasingly important to provide a high performance computing platform for these emerging data mining applications. In this paper we explore the performance characteristics of the data mining benchmark suite MineBench across three “tock” generations of Intel microarchitecture. Our objective is to study the impact of microarchitecture improvements on the performance of data mining algorithms. We present comparative microarchitecture characteristics between data mining algorithms and SPEC INT 2006 benchmarks. We have proposed a generic cycle accounting methodology to attribute performance improvements to various units of the microprocessor. The proposed methodology helps differentiate the impact on performance due to front-end and back-end microarchitecture improvements.

AB  - In Web2.0 era, social media platforms are bearing huge customer base and excessively abundant information resources. On one hand, information consumers spend a lot of time in information search. On the other hand, information providers are seeking effective methods to recognize potential customers, push targeting advertising and provide personalized information services. Generally, mining user-generated content (UGC) to discover user preferences becomes the main channel for user modeling and customer partitioning. However, on social media platforms, user preferences were often manifested in the user-defined tags, online social behaviors as well as the UGC texts. The paper proposed a social-media user partitioning model based on heterogeneous information fusion and ensemble clustering. In the model, online social behaviors and user-defined interest tags are combined with UGC texts respectively to generate basic partitions of social media users. Then, basic partitions are fused into a consensus partition based on the voting mechanism for the final user partitioning. Experiments on real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB  - Over the past few years, the rapid growth and the exponential use of social digital media has led to an increase in popularity of social networks and the emergence of social computing. In general, social networks are structures made of social entities (e.g., individuals) that are linked by some specific types of interdependency such as friendship. Most users of social media (e.g., Face book, Google+, Linked In, My Space, Twitter) have many linkages in terms of friends, connections, and/or followers. Among all these linkages, some of them are more important than another. For instance, some friends of a user may be casual ones who acquaintances met him at some points in time, whereas some others may be friends that care about him in such a way that they frequently post on his wall, view his updated profile, send him messages, invite him for events, and/or follow his tweets. In this paper, we apply data mining techniques to social networks to help users of the social digital media to distinguish these important friends from a large number of friends in their social networks.

AB  - Social network analysis is a hot topic in recent years. However, how to collect, manage and analyze those large volume data effectively, is a very important problem. In this paper, we describe a system to collect, manage and mine social media data. Taking Tencent microblogs as an example, we implement a social media data collecting module based on Hadoop. In order to process data effectively and efficiently, we design a storm based managing and preprocessing system. As to the social media data analysis, we conduct topic detection based on LDA algorithm. We also propose a method to calculate the hot degree for each topic. In order to analyze the topic dynamics, we present a topic tracking method. Furthermore, we give an integrated method, which combines emotion and dictionary to analyze the sentiment of each topic. The Web-based result visualization are also implemented.

AB  - Twitter is one of social media with more than 500 million users and 400 million tweets per day. In any written tweet of Twitter users it contains various emotions. Most research on the use of social media classifies sentiments into three categories that are positive, negative, and neutral. However, none of these studies has developed an application that can detect user emotions in the social media, particularly on Twitter. Hence, this research developed a text mining application to detect emotions of Twitter users that are classified into six emotions, namely happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise. Three main phases of the text mining utilized in this application were preprocessing, processing, and validation. Activities conducted in the preprocessing phase were case folding, cleansing, stop-word removal, emoticons conversion, negation conversion, and tokenization to the training data and the test data based on the sentiment analysis that performed morphological analysis to build several models. In the processing phase, it performed weighting and classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm on the validated model. The process for measuring the level of accuracy generated by the application using 10-fold cross validation was done in the validation phase. The findings showed that this application is able to achieve 83% accuracy for 105 tweets. In order to get a higher accuracy, one requires a better model in training data.

AB  - Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a ground-breaking biomedical approach to curbing the transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Truvada, the most common form of PrEP, is a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine and is a once-daily oral mediation taken by HIV-seronegative persons at elevated risk for HIV infection. When taken reliably every day, PrEP can reduce one's risk for HIV infection by as much as 99%. While highly efficacious, PrEP is expensive, somewhat stigmatized, and many health care providers remain uninformed about its benefits. Data mining of social media can monitor the spread of HIV in the United States, but no study has investigated PrEP use and sentiment via social media. This paper describes a data mining and machine learning strategy using natural language processing (NLP) that monitors Twitter social media data to identify PrEP discussion trends. Results showed that we can identify PrEP and HIV discussion dynamics over time, and assign PrEP-related tweets positive or negative sentiment. Results can enable public health professionals to monitor PrEP discussion trends and identify strategies to improve HIV prevention via PrEP.

AB  - An increasing number of people are using online social networking services (SNSs), and a significant amount of information related to experiences in consumption is shared in this new media form. Text mining is an emerging technique for mining useful information from the web. We aim at discovering in particular tweets semantic patterns in consumers' discussions on social media. Specifically, the purposes of this study are twofold: 1) finding similarity and dissimilarity between two sets of textual documents that include consumers' sentiment polarities, two forms of positive vs. negative opinions and 2) driving actual content from the textual data that has a semantic trend. The considered tweets include consumers' opinions on US retail companies (e.g., Amazon, Walmart). Cosine similarity and K-means clustering methods are used to achieve the former goal, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic modeling algorithm, is used for the latter purpose. This is the first study which discover semantic properties of textual data in consumption context beyond sentiment analysis. In addition to major findings, we apply LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocations) to the same data and drew latent topics that represent consumers' positive opinions and negative opinions on social media.

AB  - In the Computer System we have basically three types of Resources; they are Software, Hardware and Data. Data is the most important resource of computer system, because whatever computing we are doing is just because of data. Data Science deals with large amount of data to infer knowledge from the data sets to rationalize the information to achieve business values. Traditionally information was in structured form, means that was generally generated by business transactions. This information was easily process with our traditional data management system. In past few years the amount of digital data generated was grown exponentially. This large amount of data was unstructured, which cannot be processed and extracted efficiently from our traditional system. It includes Text files, sensor data, log data, web data, social networking data etc. The major reason behind the generation of this unstructured data is various applications used via internet e.g. Smart devices, web, mobile, social media and sensor Devices. For achieving the business goals this data is essential to mine. This large amount of unstructured data is called BIG DATA [1]. It's in large volume, its varying. There are various tools are available for processing of this large amount of data. Hadoop is one of the popular and efficient tool for the processing of Big Data. Hadoop provide a framework that allows us distributed computing and run tasks in parallel such that such type of complex data can be processed efficiently with respect to time, performance and resources. This paper covers the major resources used by Hadoop cluster.

AB  - Social Media has changed the way we communicate as friends, family and citizens. Social media has allowed individuals with shared interest, regardless of geographical location, to form communities and discussion forums to share tips and tricks of their trade. As a result, platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become major sources of information for current events and community interests. In this paper we discuss privacy issues related to mining South African crime and public safety incidents from social media posts. The paper touches on matters related to ownership of social media data, privacy preservation challenges when several types of data from different sources can be integrated as well as legal protection of the processing of personal information. Finally, this paper will discuss ethical issues that arise when the data reveals information such as witnesses to a crime.

AB  - The recent era of data driven cloud computing produce enormous amount of complex data which are needed to be analyzed properly. Data acquired from various social media platforms and resources further processed through different mining tools and techniques for different aspects such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining, etc. Owing to the capability of extracting valuable opinions of consumers towards a particular event or product or blogs, this field gained a lot of attention from researchers and opinion computing become an integral part of big data mining. The existing data mining techniques lacks scalability and computational complexity issues, therefore the proposed study subjected to represent a tentative conceptual model planned for news event sentiment and opinion computation. The conceptual model thereby uses words and emoticons to extract and mine opinions from different words. It represents two different types of case study which are expected to be integrated with the futuristic Big Data Mining based applications.

AB  - High population growth, urbanization, and global climate change drive up the frequency of disasters, causing grave losses of people's lives and property worldwide. Additionally, globalization, technological development, and the changing roles of individuals in society will require entirely new approaches, tools, and capabilities to help inform decision making under uncertain conditions. However, the mismatch between the high disaster vulnerability and the low crisis response and disaster resilience becomes a critical problem for emergency management. Recent years, key advances in computing - smartphones, worldwide mobile internet access, social media and industrial big data have all contributed to break through barriers of information exchange which help disaster managers working on data-driven solutions to disaster management problems. Based on big data, the emergency managers can identify and assesse risk through critical infrastructure operating data or sensor data, and then predict the affected population through smartphone data or social media data, and finally provide an operation plan for establishing the target capabilities for a community to response to the crisis. Also, big data plays a part in providing real-time clues of on-site disaster information through data mining. Based on the analyzed real-time disaster information, the research creates real-time feedback loops on nature disaster to help the decision-makers make the real-time update, precision and dynamic rescue plan. In combination, big data can help in all four phases of disaster management: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery, and can also help us take actions to improve our city's resilience to disasters.

AB  - Information mining from large databases has become an important research topic for researchers in computer science and information technology. Data mining has been attractive to many researchers in different fields. Among these fields, urban activity summarization aims at modeling people's typical activities at different locations and time in a city. With the ever-increasing urbanization process, urban activity summarization is widely recognized as a crucial socioeconomic task. Previously, it was difficult to be done due to the lack of real-life geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data. In recent years, with the development of social media, such as tweeter and Weibo (widely used in China and similar with tweeter), there are sufficient acceptable data for solving this task. There are some progress made on the studies of geographical topics based on GTSM data, but their high computational costs and strong distributional assumptions prevent the release of GTSM data energy. In order to solve this problem, we propose a model of urban activity summarization. This model is based on the method of kernel density estimation to find out the spatiotemporal hot spots of people's activities and maximize the scarcity of GTSM data. Not only that, we have greatly reduced the time complexity by subdividing the space. Finally, we evaluate the validity of the model using the Weibo data, by comparing the results of the model prediction and the actual results, and give an answer to the proposed activities under a given time and place, as well as the recommendation of a given activity.

AB  - The increasing popularity of social networks also increased the amount of data collected in these networks. Online social applications, which are also defined as social media, provide ways of accessing large amounts of data about their users over the Internet. Not surprisingly, researchers started to focus on the data extraction process in these networks. In this context, data mining applications and data analysis allow researchers to extract some useful information about the masses and people. In this study, we examine a Turkish twitter data set using data mining techniques. Initially, Turkish tweet dataset is collected and emotional words are determined. An analysis is carried out to see if there is a relation between Turkish tweets and the Turkish stock market index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performed on Turkish tweets and stock market index.

AB  - Temporal information retrieval is widely used to organize the data according to the time considerations. Social media has rapidly changing time varying content. Temporal information retrieval has made it easy to explore this kind of dynamically changing content. Clustering involves grouping the data in such a way that their inter cluster similarity is low and intra cluster similarity is high. Similar set of data belongs to a single cluster making analysis of data easier. In this work, relevant features are extracted from the Social Media platform `Facebook'. These features form the basis for ranking and clustering of users. Proposed ranking technique involves the temporal dimension of data and comments by different users. Data mining toolkit WEKA is used for clustering. Three algorithms used for clustering are: XMeans, Expectation Maximization and Hierarchical. Comparison of results for these algorithms shows that XMeans and Expectation Maximization are better for Social Media based Temporal data rather than hierarchical clustering algorithm.

AB  - Since the seminal work of Schilit and Theimer on context-awareness in 1994, great research progress has been made in context-aware computing field. Due to limited deployment scale of sensors and devices, in early years context-aware computing focused mainly on understanding and exploiting personal context in single smart spaces. As a result of the recent explosion of sensor-equipped mobile phones, the phenomenal growth of Internet and social network services, the broader use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in all types of public transportation, and the extensive deployment of sensor network and WiFi in both indoor and outdoor environments, the digital footprints left by people while interacting with cyber-physical spaces are accumulating with an unprecedented speed and scale. The technology trend towards crowd sensing is creating new challenges and opportunities for context-aware computing - with huge amount, large scale, multi-modal, different granularity, diverse quality of data from various data sources. In this talk, I will present a new research direction called “social and community intelligence (SCI)” as a natural extension of context-aware computing in the era of crowd sensing, with emphasis on extracting community and society level context; in particular I will introduce our work in mining large scale taxi GPS data, mobile phone data and social media data for enabling innovative applications in smart cities. Finally I will briefly summarize the difference between traditional context-aware computing and SCI in terms of data acquisition, modeling, inference, storage and context inferred.

AB  - The data are generated very rapidly from different information sources. These generation of data is increasing day by day from various sources such as automated data collection tools, database systems, e-commerce and social media websites. There is an explosive growth of data from terabytes to petabytes. It is essential to extract valuable knowledge from these large data. Since large amount of data is available, people look for valuable knowledge from the available data. Several mining algorithms are used to extract interesting patterns from the data stored in a repository. Traditional data sources are static in nature that the content are not generated very rapidly. Data streams are the streams of information that are generated at very rapid rate. After the evolution of data streams, the need arises to think of a new algorithm to process it. There are various data stream algorithms used for mining the data streams with different requirements. In this work, the ensemble of classifiers model has been developed for mining the data streams by combining stream mining classifiers such as Similarity-based Data Stream Classifier (SimC) and Online Genetic Algorithm (OGA) classifier. The performance of ensemble based classifiers show improved classification accuracy and less classification error rate under various circumstances.

AB  - Social media is emerging rapidly on the internet. This media knowledge helps people, company and organizations to analyze information for important decision making. Opinion mining is also called as sentiment analysis which involves in building a system to gather and examine opinions about the product made in reviews or tweets, comments, blog posts on the web. Sentiment is classified automatically for important applications such as opinion mining and summarization. To make valuable decisions in marketing analysis where implement sentiment classification efficiently. Reviews contain sentiment which is expressed in a different way in different domains and it is costly to annotate data for each new domain. The analysis of online customer reviews in which firms cannot discover what exactly people liked and did not like in document-level and sentence-level opinion mining. So, now opinion mining ongoing research is in phrase-level opinion mining. It performs finer-grained analysis and directly looks at the opinion in online reviews. The proposed system is based on phrase-level to examine customer reviews. Phrase-level opinion mining is also well-known as aspect based opinion mining. It is used to extract most important aspects of an item and to predict the orientation of each aspect from the item reviews. The projected system implements aspect extraction using frequent itemset mining in customer product reviews and mining opinions whether it is positive or negative opinion. It identifies sentiment orientation of each aspect by supervised learning algorithms in customer reviews.

AB  - Opinions are vital in almost all human activities and are key influencers of online user's behavior. In this regard, when we need to make a decision, we often search for the opinions of others. Opinions and its related concepts such as sentiments and emotions are the subjects of study of sentiment analysis and opinion mining. The inception of mining opinions from online reviews coincide with the social media on the Web, e.g., reviews, discussion forums, blogs, micro blogs, Twitter, and social networks. Due to the large volume of opinionated data generated and available in digital forms, it become essential to mine such data and find opinions or sentiments in order to obtain the overall opinion on the topic i.e. products, politics, sports, education reforms, and so on. In this direction, it is proposed to design an algorithm which extracts opinion targets and opinion words using word alignment model for online reviews extracted from Twitter. An opinion target is defined as the topic about which users express their opinions. An opinion words are defined as the words that are used to express users' opinions. The aim of the project is to determine the thoughts of blog or review writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of online reviews using word alignment model. The key objective of this project is to design an algorithm that predict opinion words and opinion targets for analyzing the market status of a product by mining user reviews posted in social networking site namely the Twitter. For evaluation, Benchmark Customer Review Dataset and real tweets dataset pertaining to product reviews extracted using Twitter API. The results are measured in terms of Precision and Recall for accuracy of finding opinion words and targets in order to be an essential ingredient for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better accuracy in an efficient way. In addition, the ultimate outcome of this project to make choice of designing potential consumer oriented products e.g. Mobile, laptop, and so on.

AB  - Online social and news media has become a very popular for users to share their opinions. It generates rich and timely information about actual world actions of all types. Several efforts were dedicated for mining topics, sentiments and opinions automatically from natural language in news, social media messages, and commercial reviews of product and services. Social media like facebook, twitter, online review websites like Amazon are popular sites where millions of users exchange their opinions and making it a valuable platform for tracking and analyzing trending topics and sentiments. This provides important information for decision making in various domains. An enormous amount of available data requires information filtering for drilling down the relevant topics and events. Topic detection is the solution for monitoring and summarizing information generates from social sources. Various topic detection methods are available which affect the quality of result. In this paper we use BNgram which is one of the novel topic detection methods on three large Twitter datasets associated to recent events. It has been observed that the pre-processing of the data and sampling procedure are greatly affecting the quality of detected topics. On much focused topics, standard NLP techniques can do well for social streams. But for handling more heterogeneous streams novel techniques are used. BNgram method gives the best performance, thus being more reliable. In this paper we also find the sentiments of people related to events. “Sentiwordnet dictionary” is used for finding scores of each word. And then sentiments are classified as “negative, positive and neutral”.

AB  - Social media has developed rapidly, which had already affected modern people's life style. Meanwhile, social media has produced huge amounts of data. In research, we find that there is no explicit definition of user's behavior pattern in social network. Therefore, we focused on the research of that and found people who have two types of behaviors which are inseparably intertwined. The two types that mentioned are functional behaviors and social behaviors. We have defined user's behavior, and regarded user's behavior as a vertical timeline which the object of study is individual. With adding some horizontal lines which stand for social behaviors between vertical timelines, the model linked different people. Experiment's research takes Sina Weibo as an object. For obtaining the social behavior pattern, we use the generalized sequential pattern algorithm (GSP) for data mining. And the pattern is represented by the form of [User Behavior User → User Behavior User]*n. According to the result and algorithm accuracy confirmation, the frequent behavioral patterns of a certain person can be obtained. After that we can also predict user's behaviors in the future.

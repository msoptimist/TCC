AB  - Various analytical methods are applied on social media data for opinion mining, user recommondation, product advertising, and etc. They share the common requirement on collecting massive social media data, among which messages on hotspot social events are mostly valuable for understanding users' intensions. Apparently, sampling the global timeline evenly cannot meet the requirement, because it may miss important messages. In this paper, a sampling method for social streams, named as RS&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, for Real-time Social-Stream Sampler, is introduced. It adaptively samples the global timeline as well as hotspotting messages. Preliminary empirical study shows the effectiveness of RS&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We also show its application in a prototype system for social event analytics.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to explore how cybersecurity policies pertaining to data privacy, data acquisition, data fusion and data mining, impact the feasibility and functionality of Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS). In this work, a social media network model, will serve as the DDDAS of study in order to reveal how varying cybersecurity policies, could alter the functionality and usefulness of the system. At its fundamental level, the social media network model proposed in this work, TEchnology PHobia readiness CONdition (TEPHCON), seeks to serve as a decision support system that dynamically captures and visualizes society's affinity/aversion towards current or emerging technologies. However, at its core, this DDDAS is built upon a data platform that is highly susceptible to changes in cybersecurity policies. For example, a change in cybersecurity policies pertaining to freedom of speech in a cyber environment, may significantly alter the access and availability of publicly-available data. On the other hand, a more hands-off cyber policy pertaining to who controls cyber infrastructure networking speeds, may result in an imbalance of data that may threaten the veracity of TEPHCON. Therefore, cybersecurity policies are an integral component of DDDAS systems such as TEPHCON and as such, their impact should be explored in detail.

AB  - After the East Japan Great Earthquake occurred in Japan on 11th March 2011, many messages related to the earthquake were posted to social media. Especially, in Asian countries, a lot of messages about the earthquake were posted, so that different topics such as concerning about damages by the earthquake, afflicted people were observed, etc. observed. These topics can be recognized as reactions to the earthquake. Therefore, exploring topics related to the earthquake on social media in Asian countries gains a rich insight into the Asian social context. The goal of our research is to analyze Asian people reactions to the East Japan Great Earthquake on social media using data mining technique. As the first step, this paper targets Thai language and conducts the preliminary approximation to investigate topics on Thai social media. We analyze how Thai people reacted to the earthquake and compare with reactions in Japan.

AB  - Physical events in the real world are known to trigger reactions and then discussions in online social media. Mining these reactions through online social sensors offers a fast and low cost way to understand what is happening in the physical world. In some cases, however, further study of the affected population's emotional state can improve this understanding. In our study we analyzed how car commuters react on Twitter while stuck in heavy traffic. We discovered that the online social footprint does not necessarily follow a strict linear correlation with the volume of a traffic jam. Through our analysis we offer a potential explanation: people's mood could be an additional factor, apart from traffic severity itself, that leads in fluctuations of the observed reaction in social media. This finding can be important for social sensing applications where external factors, like sentiment, also contribute on how humans react. We propose a novel traffic-congestion estimation model that utilizes the volume of messages and complaints in online social media, based on when they happen. We show through experimental evaluation that the proposed model can estimate, with higher accuracy, traffic jam severity and compare the results with several baselines. The model achieves at least 38% improvement of absolute error and more than 45% improvement of relative error, when compared with a baseline that assumes linear correlation between traffic and social volume. To support our findings we combined data from the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) and Twitter, for a total of 6 months, and focused on a major traffic-heavy freeway in Los Angeles, California.

AB  - Social network analysis (SNA) has been a research focus in multiple disciplines for decades, including sociology, healthcare, business management, etc. Traditional SNA researches concern more human and social science aspects—trying to undermine the real relationship of people and the impacts of these relationships. While online social networks have become popular in recent years, social media analysis, especially from the viewpoint of computer scientists, is usually limited to the aspects of people's behavior on specific websites and thus are considered not necessarily related to the day-to-day people's behavior and relationships. We conduct research to bridge the gap between social scientists and computer scientists by exploring the multifacet existing social networks in organizations that provide better insights on how people interact with each other in their professional life. We describe a comprehensive study on the challenges and solutions of mining and analyzing existing social networks in enterprise. Several aspects are considered, including system issues; privacy laws; the economic value of social networks; people's behavior modeling including channel, culture, and social inference; social network visualization in large-scale organization; and graph query and mining. The study is based on an SNA tool (SmallBlue) that was designed to overcome practical challenges and is based on the data collected in a global organization of more than 400 000 employees in more than 100 countries.

AB  - Millions of patients are affected by adverse drug reactions (ADRs) every year. It represents a substantial burden on healthcare resources. Pharmacovigilance using text and data analytics has drawn substantial attention in the recent years. These techniques are mainly extracting the associations between drugs and ADRs using data sources such as spontaneous reporting systems, electronic health records, medical literature, and pharmacological databases. In this work, we are not only interested in extracting the associations between drugs and ADRs but also the associations between diseases and ADRs. There is an association between a disease and an ADR when the drugs treating the disease are associated with the same ADR, which means there might be an underlying mechanism-of-action (MOA) between the disease and the ADR [1]. The ADR can be considered as a clinical phenotypic biomarker for the disease. In addition, we are adopting the social media data as the data source in analytics. The social media provides timely and large volume of health consumer contributed information that overcomes the limitations the traditional data sources. We propose to construct a heterogeneous healthcare network from social media data and develop three path-mining techniques to the clinical phenotypic information. The experiments results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in detecting significant and novel ADR-disease associations. Case study shows that many of the association can be supported by existing academic literatures.

AB  - Twitter - a social media platform - has gained phenomenal popularity among researchers who have explored its massive volumes of data to offer meaningful insights into many aspects of modern life. Twitter has also drawn great interest from public health community to answer many health-related questions regarding the detection and spread of certain diseases. However, despite the growing popularity of Twitter as an influenza detection source among researchers, healthcare officials do not seem to be as intrigued by the opportunities that social media offers for detecting and monitoring diseases. In this paper, we demonstrate that 1) Twitter messages (tweets) can be reliably classified based on influenza related keywords; 2) the spread of influenza can be predicted with high accuracy; and, 3) there is a way to monitor the spread of influenza in selected cities in real-time. We propose an approach to efficiently mine and extract data from Twitter streams, reliably classify tweets based on their sentiment, and visualize data via a real-time interactive map. Our study benefits not only aspiring researchers who are interested in conducting a study involving the analysis of Twitter data but also health sectors officials who are encouraged to incorporate the analysis of vast information from social media data sources, in particular, Twitter.

Mining this data and making the process easier are gaining momentum in the industries. This paper describes an enterprise system we developed for extracting sentiment from large volumes of social data in Arabic dialects. First, we give an overview of the Big Data system for information extraction from multilingual social data from a variety of sources. Then, we focus on the Arabic sentiment analysis capability that was built on top of the system including normalizing written Arabic dialects, building sentiment lexicons, sentiment classification, and performance evaluation. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of enriching sentiment results with user profiles in understanding sentiments of a specific user group.

AB  - Since the evolution of computer started, the data that has been generated has also subsequently increased. Eventually, the storage costs increased, but due to advancements in technology and in the field of science these costs have drastically been reduced. Owing to this fact, the data generation has increased exponentially. In 2012, 90% of the entire data which existed in the past had been generated by the end of 2014. These massive amounts of data are usually stored in the form of data sets which are called Big Data. The concern is not the storage of this data, but the processing of the data that is being continuously generated. The data we know has been divided into three categories - Structured Data, Semi-Structured Data and Unstructured Data. 80% of the data generated around the world from various sources such as social media is in unstructured format, primarily text form, while structured data is information present in the form of titled columns and rows which can be easily processed and ordered by data mining tools. We also have semi-structured forms of data which do not conform to any of the previous models mentioned or generic relational database models but contain tags or other markers which are used to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. To process this kind of gargantuan amounts data we have different kind of tools in Hadoop, namely - MapReduce, Pig and Hive.

AB  - Summary form only given. The extremely fast grow of Internet Services, Web and Mobile Applications and advance of the related Pervasive, Ubiquity and Cloud Computing concepts have stimulated production of tremendous amounts of data partially available online (call metadata, texts, emails, social media updates, photos, videos, location, etc.). Even with the power of today's modern computers it still big challenge for business and government organizations to manage, search, analyze, and visualize this vast amount of data as information. Data-Intensive computing which is intended to address this problems become quite intense during the last few years yielding strong results. Data intensive computing framework is a complex system which includes hardware, software, communications, and Distributed File System (DFS) architecture. Just small part of this huge amount is structured (Databases, XML, logs) or semi-structured (web pages, email), over 90% of this information is unstructured, what means data does not have predefined structure and model. Generally, unstructured data is useless unless applying data mining and analysis techniques. At the same time, just in case if you can process and understand your data, this data worth anything, otherwise it becomes useless. Two key components of any Data-intensive system are: Data Storage and Data Processing. So, which technologies, techniques, platforms, tools are best for Big Data storing and processing? How Big Data Era effect technological landscape? These and many other questions will be answered during a speech.

In order to accomplish these goals, investigators become very interest in social network analysis to conclude certain behavior or prediction from various data in social networks. People in the field of sociology expect that the relationship between people and the real-life style can be mirrored in the social networks. On the other hand, manual classification of unstructured data from social networks is almost impossible. Therefore, there is a required for an automatic classification method in order to formulate this data and to be more convenient and accessible. In this paper we are studying data of diseases from Facebook pages. These diseases are associated to the categories of popular diseases such as Ebola, Malaria and HIV/AIDS. In this paper we addressed classifier as a supervised learning task and an innovative dataset named Benchmark Dataset for Diseases Classification (BDDC) is created. BDDC is well-documented dataset and its file formats and compatible with recognized text mining tools and to be utilized in the comparative experiments by other researchers. Three commonly classifiers are used and two versions are BDDC are used. The performance results show that BDDC with stemmer performs better than the one without stemmer because of using stop words filtering and porter.

AB  - Social networks or virtual communities have become new marketing media. Businesses develop new recommender systems by incorporating social network information to promote their products. Because of the characteristic of social network users' similar tastes, the social recommender systems help the businesses to increase their marketing share easily. In order to attract more new fans, the data mining communities propose methods to analyze purchasing behaviors among social network visitors to improve recommender systems' efficiency. However, the implicit dissimilar purchasing behaviors among existing fans and the reasons behind such behaviors may also help the business to have a better understanding of community evolution and improve the marketing sale plans to stick the fans by the group. This paper will transform the fans' purchasing data set into a transaction data set and propose a framework to mine the implicit outlier behaviors with the reasons that induce those behaviors. The experiment is given to show the advantages of the proposed framework.

AB  - In recent years, the number of data circulating on the Internet has exploded causing the phenomenon of "Big Data". In the health field, the mass of data circulating on the Internet has also become bloated. From a study conducted within the french medical health service, this article aims to explore the construction of knowledge generated by the "Sanitary Big Data". It analyzes the creation of value made and the limitations of this “ Big Data". The result is a an exploitation of polymorphic data mainly from global programs for infectious disease surveillance including PromedMail and Sentiweb. It shows the use of data from clinical trials of the Cochrane Library and the use of data of social medias and social networks. This real time data are exhautive of the population's health status. It also shows the construction of knowledge, which quickly reveals the emergence of diseases that may affect the forces in operation, as in 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic. We may also mention the anticipation of new pharmaceutical innovations, for example to detect the effectiveness of new treatments, such as in the context of the current epidemic of Ebola. As main limitations, it shows a data mining that does not offer interpretation of results and potential ethical drifts on handling health data.

AB  - Social media enable people to share significant events from their daily life. Social data mining evolves the challenge of dealing with casual language extraction due to the unstructured social media content: social media users often prefer communicating unconventionally with informal language using abbreviations, slang, misspelled words, or non-standard short-forms. Thereby, this paper proposes a new open-domain event schema discovery approach using casual language normalization to normalize, extract events and discover their adequate schemas (event types and argument roles) from noisy corpus. The proposed approach exploits casual language normalization to improve both tasks of event schema discovery and event extraction. This approach can automatically normalize and generate high-quality schemas from the extracted events with unknown types. The introduced approach promises better results in terms of accuracy and quality of the discovered schemas.

AB  - From the day internet came into existence, the era of social networking sprouted. In the beginning, no one may have thought internet would be a host of numerous amazing services like the social networking. Today we can say that online applications and social networking websites have become a non separable part of one's life. Many people from diverse age groups spend hours daily on such websites. Despite the fact that people are emotionally connected together through social media, these facilities bring along big threats with them such as cyber attacks, which includes online grooming and cyberbullying. The primary objective of this project is to detect such cases over the social media and implement some preventive measures so as to avoid such incidents. Using machine learning and data mining techniques we can achieve our goal. The watchdog application could find out the unexpected, unpleasant and unwanted content that could be abusive-disrespectful text or nude images or unpermitted actions and help user removing it or preventing it from being spread all over. This will help the public to assure safety and nonviolence.

AB  - In recent years, data mining techniques has been used widely to address the problem of huge data sets stored on huge, heterogeneous data warehouses and may be located in different sites. Rapid growth of data arise in many areas like healthcare, social media, science, Internet...etc. Multi-agent technology has improved the processing of such huge data by the use of the agent technology along with data mining techniques in dealing with them. We found that processing time is minimized and accuracy is increased when merging data mining classification techniques in a multi-agent system. In this paper, we introduce a multiple learner multi-agents system (MLMAS) where each agent represents a classifier. Each classifier agent will work separately and cooperatively with other agents to gain best results, the results of classifiers are then combined either by a coordinator Agent using a weighted voting technique or according to the probability distribution of classifiers' results. This system has implemented using JADE package and WEKA classifiers.

AB  - Micro logging websites, like Twitter, as a new social media form are growing increasingly popular. Compared with the traditional medias, such as New York Times, tweets are structured data form and with shorter length. Although traditional topic modeling algorithms have been studied well, few algorithms are specially designed to mine Twitter data according to its own features. In this paper, according to the structure of Twitter data, we introduce Multi Topic Distribution Model to mine topics. In addition, we have observed that one tweet mostly discusses either public issues or personal lives. Former studies equally analyze all tweets and fail to discover interests of each individual. With the help of features of Twitter data, dividing topics into two types in semantics, our model not only efficiently discover topics, but also is able to indicate which topics are interested by an user and which topics are hot issues of the Twitter community. Through Gibbs sampling for approximate inference, the experiments are conducted in the TREC2011 data set. Experimental results on the data set have shown an comparison between our model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Author Topic Model. We also illustrate an example of topics which are interested by the whole community and several users.

AB  - Most of today's commercial companies heavily rely on social media and community management tools to interact with their clients and analyze their online behaviour. Nonetheless, these tools still lack evolved data mining and visualization features to tailor the analysis in order to support useful marketing decisions. We present an original methodology that aims at formalizing the marketing need of the company and develop a tool that can support it. The methodology is derived from the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) and includes additional steps dedicated to the design and development of visualizations of mined data. We followed the methodology in two use cases with Swiss companies. First, we developed a prototype that aims at understanding the needs of tourists based on Flickr and Instagram data. In that use case, we extend the existing literature by enriching hashtags analysis methods with a semantic network based on Linked Data. Second, we analyzed internal customer data of an online discount retailer to help them define guerilla marketing measures. We report on the challenges of integrating Facebook data in the process. Informal feedback from domain experts confirms the strong potential of such advanced analytic features based on social data to inform marketing decisions.

AB  - Social media constitute a challenging new source of information for intelligence gathering and decision making. Twitter is one of the most popular social media sites and often becomes the primary source of information. Twitter messages are short and well suited for knowledge discovery. Twitter provides both researchers and practitioners a free Application Programming Interface (API) which allows them to gather and analyse large data sets of tweets. Twitter data are not only tweet texts, as Twitter's API provides more information to perform interesting research studies. The paper briefly describes process of data gathering and the main areas of data mining, knowledge discovery and data visualisation from Twitter data.

AB  - Text data understanding on social networking systems has become an important source of data for companies to understand their stakeholders better. The shift from pattern mining of structured database to non-structured text data has alerted companies to have a stronger presence in the new social media world. This research uses text miner module in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) to analyze conversational data compiled from Yammer enterprise microblogging system. These inputs are used to study the topics discussed among employees. It is also used to examine the knowledge sharing activity among employees in the case company. This can be accomplished by analyzing the topics maps produced SAS software system. One is able to analyze the topic of discussion and the frequency of each topic on microblogging system platforms to observe the knowledge sharing and knowledge creation activity among employees. The case study company in this research project is a knowledge centric organization involves in knowledge sharing activity using a server-based Knowledge Management System (KMS). This research chooses employees that are involved in an active project. They will use Yammer instead of the current KMS system. The topic and text analysis diagrams are used to identify the patterns of discussion and the topics exchanged between employees. SAS (Statistical Analysis System) text mining tool is used to carry out the text mining analysis works where a number of visual representation graph were developed to study the communication patterns among employees. The results of this research had shown that text mining is able to surface employees' frequency of communication and topics of conversation through posting activities using Yammer in this research.

AB  - The growth of social media has been exponential in the recent years. Immense amount of data is being put out onto the public domain through social media. This huge publicly available data can be used for research and a variety of applications. The objective of this paper is to counter problems with the social media dataset, namely : short text nature - the limited quantity of text data (140 to 160 characters), continuous streaming nature, usage of short forms and modern slangs and increasing use of sarcasm in messages and posts. Sarcastic tweets can mislead data mining activities and result in wrong classification. This paper compares various classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Adaptive Boost, Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naïve Bayes to detect sarcasm in tweets from the Twitter Streaming API. The best classifier is chosen and paired with various pre-processing and filtering techniques using emoji and slang dictionary mapping to provide the best possible accuracy. The emoji and slang dictionary being the novel idea introduced in this paper. The obtained results can be used as input to other research and applications.

AB  - The data mined from social networks has been shown to have an inherent wealth of information. However the heterogeneous nature of this data along with difficulties in predetermining its rate and source makes collecting and aggregating it an often inefficiently run task. This paper presents a platform which leverages some of the architecture and features of Cloud computing in order to dynamically scale resources according to data rate, so as to collect and parse data from a variety of social media sources in an economical manner. The nature of the platform means that it may be applied to a variety of social network monitoring tasks, which may take advantage of the dynamic and economical nature of Cloud-based architectures. This paper addresses a gap in the current literature and proposes a novel Cloud Enabled Social Media Monitoring Platform for Events Detection and Prediction.

AB  - Organizations have understood the value of their structured data - mostly financial transactions - since the first mainframes were developed in the 40's. Data quality issues have always been a challenge and the increasing numbers of applications consuming and producing structured transactional data has grown exponentially. Unstructured information has been given less significance and strategic importance and therefore fewer resources and less attention on the part of leadership. All of that has changed and is changing faster than anyone imagined. Unstructured content is what humans produce. They create the documents: strategies, proposals, support documents, marketing content, white papers, engineering specifications, etc. that form the intelligence and core knowledge capital of the enterprise. Many organizations have left business units to fend for themselves and &amp;#x201C;go figure it out&amp;#x201D; with little guidance or support. These has led to terabytes of content that people cannot find their way through and that leaves the organization open to risks, liabilities and costs of e discovery. According to the Minnesota Journal of Law, Science &amp;amp; Technology, a gig of data costs $30,000 in e discovery costs. The cost of storage is ten cents. The problem is that the enterprise does not understand the hidden costs of not making data accessible and usable - lost time, lost IP, inefficiency, poor customer service that can lead to lost customers, slower growth, etc. As newer collaboration technologies are deployed, they expose the bad habits and sins of the past. Deploying a new search engine shows that the content is not curated. Standing up a new content management application like SharePoint reveals the haphazard shanty town of an information architecture with inconsistencies in models, terminology and applications. Today's landscape of marketing and customer experience technologies is complex and interconnected and requires those upstream knowledge processes that produce unstructured content as the fuel. Customer experience entails everything that happens before you purchase (marketing, education and outreach), when you purchase (e commerce with product content and data), and after you purchase (self-service systems and knowledge bases that support the call center). This is the customer lifecycle and at each step in the process systems and tools need to be harmonized as they gather information about the users using attribute models that are consistent and that serve the business and the customer. They take content and data as input and then output more data. One applications exhaust is another applications fuel. Organizations are also purchasing data streams to enrich their internal information sources. Social media is an enormous virtually untapped reservoir of data about customers and what they think about organizations. This can be mined for sentiment and to gauge marketing effectiveness. Increasingly, much of this is being placed into the hands of the marketing organization. In fact, a study by Gartner Group said that by 2017 the CMO will spend more money on IT than the CIO. What all of this means is that information, content and data governance need to be considered as part of a whole and not as separate initiatives. Elements of good information governance include: Deployment and Operationalization; Alignment with User Needs; Business Value; Buy-In and Change Management; Sponsorship and Accountability Leads to the following outcomes: Manages conflicts in business priorities (between initiatives, business units, drivers, etc); Allows for ongoing input from various stakeholders and constituencies in order to evolve capabilities with the needs of the business; Prioritizes efforts and allocation of resources; Assigns roles and responsibilities with accountability to critical functions; Takes into consideration various levels of maturity in the organization - no one size fits all; Ensures that investments in systems, processes and tools are providing sufficient return to the business; Balances centralized standards with decentralized decision making; Aligns incentives to use a system with business goals This session will review governance concepts, discuss how they apply to various types of data and content and provide a framework for developing governance processes and structures.

AB  - Recent innovations in text mining facilitate the use of novel data for sentiment analysis related to financial markets, and promise new approaches to the field of behavioural finance. Traditionally, text mining has allowed a near-real time analysis of available news feeds. The recent dissemination of web 2.0 has seen a drastic increase of user participation, providing comments on websites, social networks and blogs, creating a novel source of rich and personal sentiment data potentially of value to behavioural finance. This study explores the efficacy of using novel sentiment indicators from MarketPsych, which analyses social media in addition to newsfeeds to quantify various levels of individual's emotions, as a predictor for financial time series returns of the Australian Dollar (AUD) - US Dollar (USD) exchange rate. As one of the first studies evaluating both news and social media sentiment indicators as explanatory variables for linear and nonlinear regression algorithms, our study aims to make an original contribution to behavioural finance, combining technical and behavioural aspects of model building. An empirical out-of-sample evaluation with multiple input structures compares multivariate linear regression models (MLR) with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for descriptive modelling. The results indicate that sentiment indicators are explanatory for market movements of exchange rate returns, with nonlinear MLPs showing superior accuracy over linear regression models with a directional out-of-sample accuracy of 60.26% using cross validation.

AB  - People now feel more comfortable socializing over the internet through popular social networking and media websites than face to face. Thus, the social media websites are thriving more and more nowadays. Like others YouTube is a vastly popular social media site which is expanding at very fast pace. YouTube depends mostly on user created contents and sharing and spreading. Business entities and public figures are taking advantage of this popularity by creating their own page and shared information among the large number of visitors. However, due to this popularity, YouTube has become more susceptible to different types of unwanted and malicious spammer. Currently, YouTube does not have any way to handle its video spammers. It only considers mass comments or messages to be part of spamming. To increase the popularity of a video, malicious users post video response spam, where the video content is not related to the topic being discussed in the particular video or does not contain the media it is supposed to. In this research, we explore different attributes that could lead to video spammers. We first collect data of YouTube videos and manually classify them as either legitimate videos or spams. We then devise a number of attributes of videos which could potentially be used to detect spams. We apply Microsoft SQL Server Data Mining Tools (SSDT) to provide a heuristic for classifying an arbitrary video as either spam or legitimate. Our result demonstrates that in the long run we could successfully classify videos as spam or legitimate videos for most of the cases.

AB  - Social media networks contain both content and context-specific information. Most existing methods work with either of the two for the purpose of multimedia mining and retrieval. In reality, both content and context information are rich sources of information for mining, and the full power of mining and processing algorithms can be realized only with the use of a combination of the two. This paper proposes a new algorithm which mines both context and content links in social media networks to discover the underlying latent semantic space. This mapping of the multimedia objects into latent feature vectors enables the use of any off-the-shelf multimedia retrieval algorithms. Compared to the state-of-the-art latent methods in multimedia analysis, this algorithm effectively solves the problem of sparse context links by mining the geometric structure underlying the content links between multimedia objects. Specifically for multimedia annotation, we show that an effective algorithm can be developed to directly construct annotation models by simultaneously leveraging both context and content information based on latent structure between correlated semantic concepts. We conduct experiments on the Flickr data set, which contains user tags linked with images. We illustrate the advantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art multimedia retrieval techniques.

AB  - Text similarity is one of the important methods of text data analysis, which is often used in text clustering and classification. Social media is a new and popular online social application that contains a lot of valuable information. Short text is common in social media, and short text similarity is often used for social media data mining. The similarity calculation of short text is influenced by the small feature of text words and the accuracy is low. so it is a common improvement method to calculate the similarity of short texts with word semantic similarity. This paper put forward a short text semantic similarity calculation method that combine knowledge-based method and corpus-based method. This method is based on the improved word semantic similarity calculation method and general short text semantic similarity calculation method. The word similarity calculation method combines two word semantic similarity by some strategies. It takes the advantages of two methods to overcome the disadvantages of single one, finds out more semantic association among words in texts, and improves accuracy of word similarity calculation. This paper uses a large number of corpus to compare and analyze several word and text semantic similarity algorithms, the improved method has a closer result to human ratings than other methods in both word and text similarity.

AB  - Web mining is a well established field with many applications. Over the last years we experience a vast and rapidly growing amount of multimedia content that becomes available online. Web 2.0 and online social networks have dramatically influenced the growing amount of multimedia content due to the fact that users become more active producers and distributors of such multimedia context. Web mining techniques and theory need to be expanded in order to include new emerging research trends from mining such heterogeneous new web data. This work conceptualizes and introduces the concept of social multimedia mining as a new emerging research area that combines web mining research, multimedia research and social media research.

AB  - With the popularity of social media (e.g., Facebook and Flicker), users could easily share their check-in records and photos during their trips. In view of the huge amount of check-in data and photos in social media, we intend to discover travel experiences to facilitate trip planning. Prior works have been elaborated on mining and ranking existing travel routes from check-in data. We observe that when planning a trip, users may have some keywords about preference on his/her trips. Moreover, a diverse set of travel routes is needed. To provide a diverse set of travel routes, we claim that more features of Places of Interests (POIs) should be extracted. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Keyword-aware Skyline Travel Route (KSTR) framework that use knowledge extraction from historical mobility records and the user's social interactions. Explicitly, we model the "Where, When, Who" issues by featurizing the geographical mobility pattern, temporal influence and social influence. Then we propose a keyword extraction module to classify the POI-related tags automatically into different types, for effective matching with query keywords. We further design a route reconstruction algorithm to construct route candidates that fulfill the query inputs. To provide diverse query results, we explore Skyline concepts to rank routes. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, we have conducted extensive experiments on real location-based social network datasets, and the experimental results show that KSTR does indeed demonstrate good performance compared to state-of-the-art works.

AB  - In the current era of social media, opinion mining shows a remarkable significance in information retrieval and web data analysis. This new research domain becomes important as the use of social media has increased to next fold. Users here generate the content, which is in the form of emotions, comments that can be positive or negative, an individual's own view point etc. Using the social networking sites (e.g. Facebook®, twitter®), multi-media sharing sites (e.g. YouTube®, Flickr®), blogs and rich web applications as the usage of Web 2.0 increases, user can exchange or share their opinion. In this paper a detailed analysis is conducted that thoroughly discuss the domain and commonly used classification techniques to assist future research in this new emerging area. These techniques are used for Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis.

AB  - There has recently been some effort to mine social media for public sentiment analysis. Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Tweeter may well be correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, can public sentiment be analyzed to predict the movements of the stock price of a particular company? If so, is it possible for the stock price of one company to be more predictable than that of another company? Is there a particular kind of companies whose stock price are more predictable based on analyzing public sentiments as reflected in Twitter data? In this article, we propose a method to mine Twitter data for answers to these questions. Specifically, we propose to use a data mining algorithm to determine if the price of a selection of 30 companies listed in NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange can actually be predicted by the given 15 million records of tweets (i.e., Twitter messages). We do so by extracting ambiguous textual tweet data through NLP techniques to define public sentiment, then make use of a data mining technique to discover patterns between public sentiment and real stock price movements. With the proposed algorithm, we manage to discover that it is possible for the stock closing price of some companies to be predicted with an average accuracy as high as 76.12%. In this paper, we describe the data mining algorithm that we use and discuss the key findings in relation to the questions posed.

AB  - Big data is a popular term used to describe the exponential growth and availability of data, both structured and unstructured. It can best be defined by thinking of three Vs: Big data is not just about Volume, but also about Velocity and Variety. The demand for stream processing is increasing a lot these days. The reason is that often processing big volumes of data is not enough. The increasing amount of opinionated data that is published in social media, in combination with the variety of data sources has created a demanding ecosystem for stream processing. The reason is that in order to deliver high quality knowledge extraction services, several tasks of high complexity must be accomplished and the existing solutions and architectures are not sufficient for processing huge volumes of streamed data. When opinion mining is applied in social media in order to cover the needs of businesses for brand monitoring, heterogeneous data has to be processed fast, so that a firm can react to changing business conditions in real time.

AB  - Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) have historically served as a successful tool for various data mining applications on conventional documents such as news articles or academic abstracts. However, standard use of topic models on social media posts pose several poblems because social media posts are short, messy and generated non-uniformly by the users of the social media platforms. In this paper we propose a new approach of community based document pooling to train better topic models over social media posts and address these problems without modifying the basic machinery of LDA. We compare our approach to the popular user based pooling scheme and show significant improvement in the quality of topic models.

AB  - Infectious disease epidemics such as influenza and Ebola pose a serious threat to global public health. It is crucial to characterize the disease and the evolution of the ongoing epidemic efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the disease progress and underlying contact network, but suffers from the lack of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance, but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised deep learning framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques. Specifically, this framework learns the social media users' health states and intervention actions in real time, which are regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. Conversely, the learned knowledge from social media can be fed into computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm to substantialize the above interactive learning process iteratively to achieve a consistent stage of the integration. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our approach can effectively characterize the spatiotemporal disease diffusion, outperforming competing methods by a substantial margin on multiple metrics.

AB  - The performance of movies in terms of revenue depends on many factors such as its production studio, genre, script quality, pre-release promotion etc, - all of which are traditionally used to estimate their potential success at the box office. Recently however, the “Wisdom of Crowd” and social media have been acknowledged as a strong signal in understanding consumer behavior towards media. In this paper, we discuss the impact of socially generated meta-data mined from the social multimedia sites and study the influence of social media on box- office performance and profitability of movies. Our result shows that various social media signals have varying yet significant impact in predicting the performance of movies. Our research also reveals that popularity of actor captured by follower count on Twitter is most relevant to the success of movie at theaters, and Facebook `like' signal has noise which impedes its analytical credibility.

AB  - Online social networks are increasingly being used as places where communities gather to exchange information, form opinions, collaborate in response to events. An aspect of this information exchange is how to determine if a source of social information can be trusted or not. Data mining literature addresses this problem. However, if usually employs social balance theories, by looking at small structures in complex networks known as triangles. This has proven effective in some cases, but it under performs in the lack of context information about the relation and in more complex interactive structures. In this paper we address the problem of creating a framework for the trust inference, able to infer the trust/distrust relationships in those relational environments that cannot be described by using the classical social balance theory. We do so by decomposing a trust network in its ego network components and mining on this ego network set the trust relationships, extending a well known graph mining algorithm. We test our framework on three public datasets describing trust relationships in the real world (from the social media Epinions, Slash dot and Wikipedia) and confronting our results with the trust inference state of the art, showing better performances where the social balance theory fails.

AB  - Microblogging has become an important social media for creating, sharing, or exchanging information and ideas. Social influence analysis in Microblogging is often exploited for different tasks such as information retrieval, recommendations, businesses intelligence. Most existing methods mostly rely on social links between users, failing to take advantage of characteristics of Microblogging. Furthermore, the size of Microblogging's user (i.e. Microblogger) is very large, which makes computing resource for social influence mining approach can't be satisfied by single computer. In this paper, a tensor factorization framework based on cloud computing platform is proposed for mining social influence in Microblogging. The framework has three components: a feature extraction component, a tensor factorization component and a user influence ranking component. In feature extraction component, features are extracted for capturing user social influence quantitatively through statistical analysis on the Microbloggers' relations. In tensor factorization component, tensor factorization based MapReduce model is presented to infer user's implicit user's relations. Finally, a user influence ranking function is constructed for computing user social influence in user influence ranking component. Experiments on Sina weibo dataset (Chinese Microblogging platform) show that our proposal significantly not only improves the prediction accuracy compared with two baseline methods, but also has competitive advantage for processing massive data from Microblogging.

AB  - The current practices of collecting information about market insight in music industry are through the sampling data collection using surveys, questionnaires and interviews. With the availibility of large-scale online conversation data, we can get faster; cheaper and more accurate data represent the actual phenomena of the market. The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach for helping the music industry parties to utilize network data mining methodology to identify one important insight in understanding music industry market, which is identification of music fans groups or conversations topics. Kaskus, the biggest online forum in Indonesia is a common media for millions Indonesian to discuss about many things, including their music preference. Last.fm is a social network of music enthusiasts. We mine Last.fm conversational topics in Kaskus and model those data using Social Network Analysis methodology based on graph model. We implement community detection algorithms to identify group identification. We show that network interaction pattern among the users in online forum can be used to help music industry parties identify the dominant topics and/or dominant music fans group in Indonesia.

AB  - Social media data are effectively used in organizations to gain popularity among its users. Here each user can share their ideas about different things (i.e. product views, general issues and so on.)In this case, sentiment analysis or opining mining is useful for mining facts from those data. The text data obtained from the social network primarily undergoes emotion mining to examine the sentiment of the user message. Most of the sentiment or emotional mining uses machine learning approaches for better results. The principle idea behind this article is to bring out the process involved in sentiment analysis. Further the investigation is about the various methods or techniques existing for performing sentiment analysis. It also presents the various tools used to demonstrate the process involved in sentiment analysis. This article reports about the opportunities and issues existing in the sentiment analysis.

AB  - In the current scenario, the data on the web is growing exponentially. Social media is generating a large amount of data such as reviews, comments, and customers' opinions on a daily basis. This huge amount of user generated data is worthless unless some mining operations are applied to it. As there are a number of fake reviews so opinion mining technique should incorporate Spam detection to produce a genuine opinion. Nowadays, there are a number of people using social media opinions to create their call on shopping for product or service. Opinion Spam detection is an exhausting and hard problem as there are many faux or fake reviews that have been created by organizations or by the people for various purposes. They write fake reviews to mislead readers or automated detection system by promoting or demoting target products to promote them or to or to degrade their reputations. In this paper, the proposed technique includes ontology, Geo location and IP address tracking, Spam words Dictionary using Naïve Bayes, Brand only review detection and tracking account used. Experimental results dictate its better results over its nearest competitors.

AB  - The growing incidents of counterfeiting and associated economic and health consequences necessitate the development of active surveillance systems capable of producing timely and reliable information for all stake holders in the anti-counterfeiting fight. User generated content from social media platforms can provide early clues about product allergies, adverse events and product counterfeiting. This paper reports a work in progress with contributions including: the development of a framework for gathering and analyzing the views and experiences of users of drug and cosmetic products using machine learning, text mining and sentiment analysis; the application of the proposed framework on Facebook comments and data from Twitter for brand analysis, and the description of how to develop a product safety lexicon and training data for modeling a machine learning classifier for drug and cosmetic product sentiment prediction. The initial brand and product comparison results signify the usefulness of text mining and sentiment analysis on social media data while the use of machine learning classifier for predicting the sentiment orientation provides a useful tool for users, product manufacturers, regulatory and enforcement agencies to monitor brand or product sentiment trends in order to act in the event of sudden or significant rise in negative sentiment.

The goal was to understand how data scientists use interpretation to complete their projects and how they communicate results to their audience. By looking at research design as both a technical roadmap and an argument, results generated from social media data sets can be evaluated for their quality. Ultimately, these results will assist in the creation of field-dependent evaluation standards than can be used by big social data researchers.

AB  - A host of tools and techniques are now available for data mining on the Internet. The explosion in social media usage and people reporting brings a new range of problems related to trust and credibility. Traditional media monitoring systems have now reached such sophistication that real time situation monitoring is possible. The challenge though is deciding what reports to believe, how to index them and how to process the data. Vested interests allow groups to exploit both social media and traditional media reports for propaganda purposes. The importance of collecting reports from all sides in a conflict and of balancing claims and counter-claims becomes more important as ease of publishing increases. Today the challenge is no longer accessing open source information but in the tagging, indexing, archiving and analysis of the information. This requires the development of general-purpose and domain specific knowledge bases. Intelligence tools are needed which allow an analyst to rapidly access relevant data covering an evolving situation, ranking sources covering both facts and opinions.

AB  - Electronic commerce includes all business conduct through information and communication technology. Development of infrastructure, telecommunications, mobile technologies, the internet and social media in recent years, made a tremendous growth in business through e-commerce. Now e-commerce is a vital part of the economic development and helps in employment, FDI and GDP growth in the country. More and more companies are now on the internet and smooth the progress of transactions over the web. A large volume of data generated by these e-commerce sites which are updated very frequently. To increase the sell, customer retention and effective decision making, association rule mining play a significant role. There are number of association rule mining algorithms designed for e-commerce. A few algorithms also support the incremental and interactive association mining. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive study of various association rule mining algorithms that support e-commerce transactions. The shortcoming of the various existing algorithms are also identified. Some plausible characteristics proposed as well for designing an efficient algorithm of e-commerce databases, which support incremental, interactive and multi-objective association rule mining.

AB  - Social media has given new way of communication technology for people to share their opinions, interest, sentiments. Huge amount of unstructured data is generated from social media like Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, which is repository of useful insights. Analytics can be applied to extract various useful insights form this. Main objective of this paper is to extract the knowledge from large social media data, identify the people sentiments and behavior to make cognizant decisions. Effective sentiment analysis of people emotions is necessary for complex topics like politics, government, present trends and healthcare. These objective are achieved by real time retrieval of twitter data and perform sentiment analysis. It helps to classify emotions of the people are positive, negative, happy, sad or neutral towards national parties of India (BJP and INC). Considering people emotions, parties can identify their weakness and look after improvement to fulfill society needs and work towards satisfying people requirements. Using text mining and unsupervised lexical method classified tweets related to these parties to identify people emotions for the parties.

AB  - Social media networks are becoming increasingly popular because they can satisfy diverse needs of individuals (both personal and professional). Modern mobile devices are empowered with increased capabilities, taking advantage of the technological progress that makes them smarter than their predecessors. Thus, a smartphone user is not only the phone owner, but also an entity that may have different facets and roles in various social media networks. We believe that these roles can be aggregated in a single social ecosystem, which can be derived by the smartphone. In this paper, we present our concept of the social ecosystem in contemporary devices and we attempt to distinguish the different communities that occur from the integration of social networking in our lives. In addition, we propose techniques to highlight major actors within the ecosystem. Moreover, we demonstrate our suggested visualization scheme, which illustrates the linking of entities that live in separate communities using data taken from the smartphone. Finally, we extend our concept to include various parallel ecosystems during potentially large investigations and we link influential entities in a vertical fashion. We particularly examine cases where data aggregation is performed by specific applications, producing volumes of textual data that can be analyzed with text mining methods. Our analysis demonstrates the risks of the rising “bring your own device” trend in enterprise environments.

AB  - Detection of spammer is being paid a great attention in the area of data mining and social media. In this paper, we propose a method of detecting micro-blog spammers based on characteristics of social behaviors. We get data through microblog API and crawler. We turn the research perspective from its media meaning to its social meaning. According to characteristics of social behaviors, this paper classifies the spammers into 2 categories: zombie fans and water army. We use 3 machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB) to detect spammers. The experimental results show that we achieved accuracy of 96.19% of legitimate users, 98.45% of zombie fans and 93.62% of water army based on the micro-blog data sets.

AB  - Market, a term frequently used in mass media and academic publications, is an elusive concept. In marketing, researchers and practitioners describe market as a place to exchange products and services (such as a retail market or real estate market). In economics and finance, financial and monetary concepts such as emerging markets, commodity markets, and the stock market are often mentioned. In all these areas, one of the most challenging research directions is modeling and predicting market movements. In recent years, the availability of diverse and voluminous market-related mass media and social media content (or Business Big Data) and the emergence of sophisticated, scalable text and social mining techniques present a unique opportunity for advancing research relating to smart market and money. This research area, at the intersec tion of computational and finance research, aims at developing intelligent (smart) mechanisms and algorithms for predicting market and stock performances.

AB  - Very huge quantity of data is continuously generated from a variety of different sources such as IT industries, internet applications, hospital history records, social media feeds etc. called as "Big Data". Mostly Data mining algorithms find the interesting patterns of data from the value-based database where the information is exact. It is not so easy to discover interesting patterns from big data. To abstain from squandering a ton of space &amp;amp; time in searching down frequent item uncertain big data, proposed approach permits clients to show their enthusiasm for terms of succinct anti-monotone constraint. MapReduce technique is used to mine frequent patterns. Two sets of map and reduce functions are used by proposed system to mine valid singleton and non-singleton patterns. In proposed work, UF-tree algorithm generates tree structure of dataset and UF-growth mines frequent itemsets recursively. To further reduce the search space and execution time in uncertain big data, proposed work gives importance to the frequency of items using weighting factors, and calculate expected support of item on the basis of weight. It reduces the nodes in the first level of tree, which leads to a reduction in the size of the tree and execution time.

AB  - Customer retention is of crucial importance for companies in the mobile services industry (MSI) because of the increasing competition in the mobile services sector. As a result, companies are increasingly exploiting data to address customer retention. Traditional data collection methods such as questionnaires and interviews have been utilised to address customer retention. In addition, data mining techniques such as classification and clustering have been applied to understand customer retention. The effectiveness of utilising these techniques to investigating customer retention is debatable as a result of the complexity of the mobile services market. This study proposes a novel data-driven methodological approach to investigating customer retention in the MSI, using agent based modelling and simulation (ABMS). The dataset for this study is extracted from Twitter using specific keywords to gather data from mobile services companies of interest. The design science paradigm is adopted as the overarching methodology along with a selected framework, the social media domain analysis framework (SoMeDoA) to generate customer satisfaction determinants and agent models. ABMS is performed with the established determinants to uncover the social effects of customer retention. Data analysis show that customers' environment is a key influence on their decision to remain with (or leave) their mobile services provider, with word of mouth as an important factor. Importantly, ABMS is able to explore further determinants in a wider market place.

AB  - The proliferation of social media in the recent past has provided end users a powerful platform to voice their opinions. Businesses (or similar entities) need to identify the polarity of these opinions in order to understand user orientation and thereby make smarter decisions. One such application is in the field of politics, where political entities need to understand public opinion and thus determine their campaigning strategy. Sentiment analysis on social media data has been seen by many as an effective tool to monitor user preferences and inclination. Popular text classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM are Supervised Learning Algorithms which require a training data set to perform Sentiment analysis. The accuracy of these algorithms is contingent upon the quantity as well as the quality (features and contextual relevance) of the labeled training data. Since most applications suffer from lack of training data, they resort to cross domain sentiment analysis which misses out on features relevant to the target data. This, in turn, takes a toll on the overall accuracy of text classification. In this paper, we propose a two stage framework which can be used to create a training data from the mined Twitter data without compromising on features and contextual relevance. Finally, we propose a scalable machine learning model to predict the election results using our two stage framework.

AB  - Applying data mining techniques to social media can yield interesting perspectives to understanding individual and human behavior, detecting hot issues and topics, or discovering a group and community. However, it is difficult to gather the data related to a specific topic due to the main characteristics of social media data sets: data is large, noisy, and dynamic. To collect the data related to a specific topic and keyword efficiently, we propose a new algorithm that selects the best seed nodes with limited resources and time. The algorithm also evaluates various user influence and activity factors, and updates the seed nodes dynamically during the gathering process. Furthermore, we compare two data sets collected by the algorithm and existing approaches.

Matisse addresses the challenges inherent to text stream mining through the following technical contributions: (1) robust stream data management, (2) automated sentiment/emotion analytics, (3) interactive coordinated visualizations, and (4) a flexible drill-down interaction scheme that accesses multiple levels of detail. In addition to positive/negative sentiment prediction, Matisse provides fine-grained emotion classification based on Valence, Arousal, and Dominance dimensions and a novel machine learning process. Information from the sentiment/emotion analytics are fused with raw data and summary information to feed temporal, geospatial, term frequency, and scatterplot visualizations using a multi-scale, coordinated interaction model. After describing these techniques, we conclude with a practical case study focused on analyzing the Twitter sample stream during the week of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of Matisse at providing guided situational awareness of significant trends in social media streams by orchestrating computational power and human cognition.

AB  - Graph mining is currently the focus of intense research. Major driving factors include social media, opinion mining, and the schemaless noSQL databases. Time evolving or dynamic graphs are the primary data structures in these fields. Often dynamic graphs must support persistency, meaning that from any given graph state past states can be accessed. Within the graph database context, persistency enables rollback capability, whereas in social media several phenomena such as friend deletion can be modeled. A novel, efficient, and persistent data structure based on tries is proposed. Its potential is displayed by added persistency to the deterministic Kronecker graph model.

AB  - With the development on newly social media such as micro-blog, people usually spread sentiments on various kinds of topics, and the social media has become an effective platform to mine the public opinions. As this kind of big data has the characteristic of comments diversity, it is necessary to extract useful information such as sentiment or emotion from the big data. But the traditional text mining algorithm does not fit the need with this kind of short and fractional content. This paper proposes a sentiment evaluation object extraction approach based on lexical &amp; syntactic rules. We combine the lexical analysis and dependency parsing together to extract the corresponding evaluation objects and find that the lexical rules have better performance on this kind of short content corpus. Experiment results show the feasible of the approach, and the existing problems and further works are also presented in the end.

AB  - Allergies are one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. One in five Americans suffer from either allergy or asthma symptoms. With the prevalence of social media, people sharing experiences and opinions on personal health symptoms and concerns on social media are increasing. Mining those publicly available health related data potentially provides valuable healthcare insights. In this paper, we propose a real-time allergy surveillance system that first classifies tweets to identify those that mention actual allergy incidents using bag-of-words model and NaiveBayesMultinomial classifier and applies in-depth text and spatiotemporal analysis. Our experimental results show that the proposed system can detect predominant allergy types with high precision and that allergy-related tweet volume is highly correlated to the weather data (daily maximum temperature). We believe that this is the first study that examines a large-scale social media stream for in-depth analysis of allergy activities.

AB  - The Social Media Platforms, as the one of largest part of today data traffic on the Internet, disseminate a vast volume of information, including medical information in it. Knowledge management system (KMS) approach is applied with a purpose to capture, maintain, and manage tacit or explicit knowledge available and collected within the social media platforms, organization's database, knowledge base, or document repository. By adding Indonesian Natural Language Processing (InaNLP) and Data Mining approach, our research proposed a model which is theoretically designed to improve the previous research related to social media knowledge capture model and enhance its accuracy and reliability of knowledge retrieved compared to previous knowledge capture model. Despite the proposed framework is still a theoretical model, it can be applied in medical sector of Indonesia as a big picture of medical knowledge capture model. This model mainly aimed for medical practitioner to give a quick suggestion of the diseases regarding to the early diagnose which has been taken in the first place.

AB  - In this paper, we propose and develop a platform to support data collection for mobile crowdsensing from mobile device sensors that is under-pinned by real-time mobile data stream mining. We experimentally show that mobile data mining provides an efficient and scalable approach for data collection for mobile crowdsensing. Our approach results in reducing the amount of data sent, as well as the energy usage on the mobile phone, while providing comparable levels of accuracy to traditional models of intermittent/continuous sensing and sending. We have implemented our Context-Aware Real-time Open Mobile Miner (CAROMM) to facilitate data collection from mobile users for crowdsensing applications. CAROMM also collects and correlates this real-time sensory information with social media data from both Twitter and Facebook. CAROMM supports delivering real-time information to mobile users for queries that pertain to specific locations of interest. We have evaluated our framework by collecting real-time data over a period of days from mobile users and experimentally demonstrated that mobile data mining is an effective and efficient strategy for mobile crowdsensing.

AB  - The data mining is a task of analyzing the data and their hidden patterns. Therefore the classification and clustering approaches are used for performing this task. The classification of the data needs to be performing training over the similar patterns and using the training knowledge the upcoming patterns are recognized. In the data mining the text analysis is one of the popular aspects of the data mining. In this presented work the text analysis and their classification techniques are studied. In addition of that a new text classification approach is introduced for analysing the social media text. The proposed technique helps for automatically analysis of the text patterns and obtaining their positive and negative orientation according to the learned patterns. The proposed technique utilizes the word probability, sentence formation probability and the weighted indexing of the data for recognizing the orientation of the text data. The proposed technique organized in such manner by which the different combinations of the words can be analysed using the graphical approach. Therefore the computed probability and weights are used for generating the directed weighted graphs. Using this graph the upcoming technique is classified and their orientation is obtained. The implementation of the proposed text classification data model is provided using JAVA technology and their performance is also evaluated. The performance of the system is reported in terms accuracy, error rate, memory usage and the time complexity. According to the different experimental analysis the proposed technique is found accurate and efficient for text classification. Additionally that can also be extendable for finding the classes more than two classes.

AB  - Complex social network analysis methods have been applied extensively in various domains including online social media, biological complex networks, etc. Complex social networks are facing the challenge of information overload. The demands for efficient complex network analysis methods have been rising in recent years, particularly the extensive use of online social applications, such as Flickr, Facebook and LinkedIn. This paper aims to simplify the network complexity through partitioning a large complex network into a set of less complex networks. Existing social network analysis methods are mainly based on complex network theory and data mining techniques. These methods are facing the challenges while dealing with extreme large social network data sets. Particularly, the difficulties of maintaining the statistical characteristics of partitioned sub-networks have been increasing dramatically. The proposed Normal Distribution (ND) based method can balance the distribution of the partitioned sub-networks according to the original complex network. Therefore, each subnetwork can have its degree distribution similar to that of the original network. This can be very beneficial for analyzing sub-divided networks and potentially reducing the complexity in dynamic online social environment.

However, there is no detailed investigation on how accurately Web-mined data reflect real-world data. It must be problematic to idolatrously utilize the Web-mined data in public Web applications without ensuring their accuracy sufficiently. Therefore, this paper defines spatio-temporal Web Sensors by analyzing Twitter, Facebook, web logs, news sites, or the whole Web for a target natural phenomenon, and tries to validate the potential and reliability of the Web Sensors' spatio-temporal data by measuring the coefficient correlation with Japanese weather, earthquake, and influenza statistics per week by region as real-world data.

Social media have great impact on individual learning and play a role in one's decision making. In this paper, we have employed machine learning and pattern classification algorithms to see whether there exists any correlation between social media online discussion forums and people's browsing behavior. We have analyzed and proposed a new casting (predicting) model to understand the correlation between social attention and study abroad trend among Pakistani students. Analysis has been carried out with the three different parameters that include Tendency, Seasonality, and Correlation between the Google Trend tool and online discussion forums for students about the general information of studying abroad in different countries for availing different Scholarships. Correlation analysis identifies the degree of relationship or dependency between these two variables. Proposed work offers novel point of view in the area of data mining and machine learning to investigate and predict the relationship between study-abroad tend and browsing behavior of Pakistani students.

AB  - In severe outbreaks such as Ebola, bird flu and SARS, people share news, and their thoughts and responses regarding the outbreaks on social media. Understanding how people perceive the severe outbreaks, what their responses are, and what factors affect these responses become important. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of understanding and mining the spread of Ebola-related information on social media. In particular, we (i) conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis of geotagged social media messages to understand citizen reactions regarding Ebola; (ii) build information propagation models which measure locality of information; and (iii) analyze spatial, temporal and social properties of Ebola-related information. Our work provides new insights into Ebola outbreak by understanding citizen reactions and topic-based information propagation, as well as providing a foundation for analysis and response of future public health crises.

AB  - Social media has long been a popular resource for sentiment analysis and data mining. In this paper, we learn to predict reader interest after article reading using social interaction content in social media. The abundant interaction content (e.g., reader feedback) aims to replace typically private reader profile and browse history. Our method involves estimating interest preferences with respect to article topics and identifying quality social content concerning informativity. During interest analysis, we combine and transform articles and their reader responses into PageRank word graph to balance author- and reader-end influence. Semantic features of words, such as their content sources (authors vs. readers), syntactic parts-of-speech, and degrees of references (i.e., significances) among authors and readers, are used to weight PageRank word graph. We present the prototype system, Interest Finder, that applies the method to reader interest prediction by calculating word interestingness scores. Two sets of evaluation show that traditional, local Page Rank can more accurately cover more span of reader interest with the help of topical interest preferences learned globally, word nodes' semantic information, and, most important of all, quality social interaction content such as reader feedback.

AB  - User generated content in online social media is growing rapidly, which makes it hard to be validated and verified. Facebook and Twitter are the most popular social media that are being used as a means of social communication and sharing thoughts, knowledge and even news. Information in these social networks can be generated by anyone from anywhere in anytime. Classifying such huge information using traditional data mining classification algorithms is time consuming task which needs huge processing and memory space. In this paper, we propose a new threshold-based approach for classifying information in social network that can give accurate result similar to support vector machine (SVM) with less processing time and consuming less memory space compare to SVM. We applied our experiment on Twitter accounts by monitoring KSU, SPP_KSU and SSS_KSU followers' accounts and compare our results with SVM results that applied by Research Chair of Pervasive and Mobile Computing (CPMC) in KSU on the same followers' accounts.

AB  - The rise of social media (such as online web forums and social networking sites) has attracted interests to mining and analyzing opinions available on the web. The online opinion has become the object of studies in many research areas; especially that called “Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis”. Several interesting and advanced works were performed on few languages (in particular English). However, there were very few studies on some languages such as Arabic. This paper presents the study we have carried out to address the problem of unbalanced data sets in supervised sentiment classification in an Arabic context. We propose three different methods to under-sample the majority class documents. Our goal is to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methods with the common random under-sampling. We also aim to evaluate the behavior of the classifier toward different under-sampling rates. We use two different common classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The experiments are carried out on an Arabic data set that we have built from Aljazeera's web site and labeled manually. The results show that Naïve Bayes is sensitive to data set size, the more we reduce the data the more the results degrade. However, it is not sensitive to unbalanced data sets on the contrary of Support Vector Machines which is highly sensitive to unbalanced data sets. The results show also that we can rely on the proposed techniques and that they are typically competitive with random under-sampling.

AB  - As the data sets in the world are growing at an exploding rate, research and analysis to derive value from this data has gained ground. Social media is a prime contributor to this data most of which is unstructured. The growing popularity of multimedia and mobile devices has created an overgrowing interconnected network where people are communicating on-the-go, sharing opinions on public forums, blogs, social networking websites. In this context, Twitter has emerged as a major platform to share one's ideas and opinions and millions of users are `tweeting' every second to generate a continuous influx of real-time data. Organizations are tapping into this data to gauge the general opinion or sentiment among the people and methods &amp;amp; techniques are being proposed for sentiment analysis &amp;amp; opinion mining. This has emerged as an active area of research and has a wide range of applications in every field.

AB  - Social Media (SM) data are growing, and SM is becoming an acceptable part of daily life for billions of people around the world. Extracting information from Social Networking Sites (SNS) can provide great challenges as well as opportunities. Using SM data beyond day-to-day communication can provide additional values. There is much research and many products that are dedicated to take SNS beyond communication channels. In our research, we are going beyond specific tools inherent to the SM tools, such as Hashtag mentions and Like counts. Instead it will use text-based modeling, data mining techniques, natural process language, machine language, etc. to understand SM content to produce numeric ratings. The final contribution of this research is building a SM users' rating model for an event using SM data. At this point of our research, we are laying out a road map.

AB  - Millions of data are collected daily in the social media environment. This data mostly reflects people's ideas in a certain topic. Emotion analysis is a new data mining subfield and is usually concerned with information extraction and identification from emotions in social media. Twitter is a platform where users share their ideas through messages. These messages can be classified to analyze the feelings of users in a specific context and to find out the points of view. In this study, a K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm, which is based on particle swarm optimization, has been proposed to classify Twitter data. The proposed study is compared with different methods on specific benchmark data sets and the accuracy of the method has been proven.

AB  - The rapidly increasing attention to customer behavior and satisfaction by department stores and commercial companies and development in social media as well as online systems has promoted production and research in user engagement pattern recognition, user network analysis, topic detection from customer feedback, text-based sentiment analysis, etc. With the development of Internet of Things and social media network, ethics consideration has also playing an important role in application of big data, especially customer behavior and feedback mining. Our proposed novel system, which extracts the important topics or issues from Skype customer feedback sources and measures the emotion associated with those topics using Vibe metric, can be a good example in this area. Unlike other previous research, which has focused on extracting the user sentiments either globally or in separate topics, our work focuses on tracking the correlated emotional trajectories across all the important issues from Skype customer feedback over time. Moreover, it also provides a platform for both studying customer emotions and tracking how the emotions regarding different important topics correlatively change over time by leveraging unstructured textual customer feedback data and structured user activity telemetry data.

AB  - For more than a decade, researchers have been proposing various methods and techniques to mine social tagging data and to learn structured knowledge. It is essential to conduct a comprehensive survey on the related work, which would benefit the research community by providing better understanding of the state-of-the-art and insights into the future research directions. The paper first defines the spectrum of Knowledge Organization Systems, from unstructured with less semantics to highly structured with richer semantics. It then reviews the related work by classifying the methods and techniques into two main categories, namely, learning term lists and learning relations. The method and techniques originated from natural language processing, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, and the Semantic Web are discussed in detail under the two categories. We summarize the prominent issues with the current research and highlight future directions on learning constantly evolving knowledge from social media data.

AB  - Social media plays an increasingly important role in people's life. Microblogging is a form of social media which allows people to share and disseminate real-life events. Broadcasting events in microblogging networks can be an effective method of creating awareness, divulging important information, and so on. However, many existing approaches at dissecting the information content primarily discuss the event detection model and ignore the user interest which can be discovered during event evolution. This leads to difficulty in tracking the most important events as they evolve including identifying the influential spreaders. There is further complication given that the influential spreaders interests will also change during event evolution. The influential spreaders play a key role in event evolution and this has been largely ignored in traditional event detection methods. To this end, we propose a user-interest model-based event evolution model, named the hot event evolution model. This model not only considers the user interest distribution but also uses the short text data in the social network to model the posts and the recommend methods to discover the user interests. This can resolve the problem of data sparsity, as exemplified by many existing event detection methods, and improve the accuracy of event detection. A hot event automatic filtering algorithm is initially applied to remove the influence of general events, improving the quality and efficiency of mining the event. Then, an automatic topic clustering algorithm is applied to arrange the short texts into clusters with similar topics. An improved user-interest model is proposed to combine the short texts of each cluster into a long text document simplifying the determination of the overall topic in relation to the interest distribution of each user during the evolution of important events. Finally, a novel cosine measurebased event similarity detection method is used to assess correlation between events, thereby detecting the process of event evolution. The experimental results on a real Twitter data set demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed model for both event detection and user interest discovery during the evolution of hot events.

AB  - Collective synchronous behavior is a pervasive phenomenon that has attracted many researchers' interests over past decades. It can be observed in many areas easily, including biology, chemistry, physics and social society. A series of interactive processes in-between individuals trigger the formation of collective behavior. Traditional data mining methods, however, mainly concentrate on the analysis of individual behavior but ignore the potential associations. Similarly, in sociology, many well-known models based on survey sampling are not suitable for the new emerging social media platform any more, where huge amounts of data are generated by users every day. It is necessary for researchers to develop effective approaches for sampling and modeling the collective behavior on social media. In this paper, we propose an innovative model that consists of multiple hidden Markov chains. By learning a group of time-series behavior data, our model can not only predict the synchronous state of a collective, but also measure the dependency property, namely reactive factor, of each individual. Preliminary experimental result shows that CoSync model has the power to distinguish behavior patterns of different persons.

AB  - Social Media is being used as a key platform by advertisers to improve business by providing targeted and personalized advertising. There exist a trade-off between productivity in advertising and invasion of user's privacy in the existing approaches. Due to these privacy concerns, there were many law suits filed against the Beacon[1] advertising model used by Facebook resulting in its discontinuation. The new approaches need to address targeted audience while preserving the privacy in order to build appropriate revenue model for their operations. In this paper we propose an innovative model that leverage the trade-off. The model effectively interacts with user's linked data present in the web structured format, retrieve it and integrate data from marketing partners. Then it broadcasts the advertisement in social graph with flexible sentences For targeted advertising and privacy our model maintains interaction records among users in virtual containers for finding tie-strength[2] and also active friends &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; by Association Rules Mining [ARM] algorithm. We applied and validated our approach using a real data set obtained from 506 active social media users.

AB  - We don't have a choice on whether we DO social media, the question is how well we DO it. To track the mood of people about any particular product by review we use opinion mining which is a natural language processing technique. Customer review analysis is most important only by which product is rated and it is a major problem today. Reviews from social media are collected manually and then pre-processed to gather the opinions. Collection of the data sets and processing it has shown positive results. The proposed method can also be used in food, beverages and in any daily consumer products to find out the whether the customer is satisfied or not. Thus, paper is about opinion mining of the drug Ativan, which is used to treat anxiety disorders. Ativan like any other drug has both pros and cons in such a case an analysis on it has to be made in order to make life more easy.

AB  - Assessing and managing the expertise of employees in knowledge and service industries is critical because human capital is the key differentiator among companies. Moreover, professional social networks are becoming increasingly popular. Besides the well-known public professional social network site Linked In, enterprise social networks are also now being widely used inside corporations and companies. In this paper, we address the critical workforce analytics problem of automatically assessing employees' skills by mining multiple cues found in enterprise and social data. In particular, we treat the assessment of employees' expertise as a matrix completion problem, where the rows represent individual employees and the columns represent individual skills. The multiple cues about employee expertise come from data we integrate on the existing skill assessment process within the company, the social networking and social media activity of the employees, and the semantic similarity of skills. Assessment results are evaluated as a binary classification recommendation. Extensive empirical study using a real-world data set from a large multinational Fortune 500 corporation corroborates the effectiveness of multi-cue analytics to improve the coverage and accuracy of skill assessment.

AB  - To create a sentimental analysis tool for opinion mining of social media data. Information available from social networks is beneficial for analysis of user opinion, for example measuring the feedback on a recently released product, movie or a MOOC, policy change or ongoing events. Using Social network APIs, Python NLTK, automatic collection of a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinion mining purposes is done. Using the corpus we build a sentiment classifier based on Naive Bayes classification that is very accurate, that is able to determine positive, negative and objective sentiments for a document with specificity factor. We also summarize the given input content.

We present a novel technique for the representation of social interactions as users' behavioral contingencies in the form of if-then rules, and for the evaluation of the contingencies using data mining procedures. We present the results of applying our technique in a group of Facebook users, identifying the social interactions in which users were more involved the most.

AB  - In today's world the modern generation applications such as social media application, web based application, big data analytics producing huge amount of data which brings up many challenges to data mining algorithm such as Decision Tree algorithms. First, as challenge is regarding volume of data which is growing terabyte to petabyte, larger dataset takes more time to build Decision Tree. Second, data not efficiently get stored in main memory we need to move it to secondary memory hence it will increase communication cost. Considering this challenges with traditional Decision Tree we have implemented the C4.5 which is latest Decision Tree algorithm with Map Reduce model which is suitable for parallel processing of big data. The algorithm is tested with big dataset of student alcohol consumption, experiments shows proposed algorithm is time saving and provides scalability.

AB  - As there is a exponential growth of social networks and due to large usage of social media, there is a increasing demand for data in the web for the users which leads to recent trends and ideas in the field of research. The users will be eagerly using these data for the future purpose and get information about the opinions of others thus there is a need of automatic summarization of opinion of the web users. Opinion Mining is a process of extracting and analyzing people's opinion regarding the given object and Sentiment Analysis explains about the hidden sentiments in the opinions. A most important challenge in this is to identify the sentiments and aspects and then perform the data classification based on these features and this process is called aspect based feature extraction. Opinion summarization can be done using machine learning such as maximum entropy, naive bayes, Support vector machine (SVM) model and, Random forest technique. The data sources to be taken for the proposed method are from customer review of product. In this paper experiments were conducted to compare the performance of proposed iterative decision tree method against other machine learning algorithms like SVM, Baseline, and Naive Bayes.

AB  - Probably the major approach to making predictions or recommendations about user behavior is by pairing unambiguous indicators of preference with attributes of the users who have given those indications. However, since the necessary preference data is often difficult to obtain, it is considered very valuable and often held closely by vendors and advertisers. On the other hand, while Twitter and other social media platforms provide a wealth of data about users by way of what they say or tweet, who or what they like or follow, etc., little work has been done to combine these data with indicators of preference for purposes of prediction or recommendation. In this paper we present a novel approach to mining preference data from natural language expressions in social media, which are then extrapolated to other individuals whose preferences are not known through predictive modeling. As an application for this approach, we describe the implementation of Tweetcast Your Vote, a publicly accessible system that predicted the voting decisions of Twitter users in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.

Most EDM initiatives are based on finding patterns to aid and enhance student learning and performance, while others focus on program efficiency, service improvement, and college readiness. This paper is related to a case study being conducted at Sta. Teresa School, a high school in the Northern District of a West African country looking to improve service quality. By combining its Relational Database School Management System data sets with its anticipated online community forum, and aggregating it with Social media data, the school is expected to gain new actionable insights to enhance student services. In this paper, we present a model for incorporating privacy into big data analytics architecture integration with Social media, discuss some of the school's concern related to privacy and security, and offer some delivery options for its online community forum initiative.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is one of the most useful toolsi n social media monitoring. Implementing sentiment analysis on social media data (Blogs, Twitter, and Facebook etc.) is beneficial to measure customer satisfaction and as a result can reduce production cost for a company. Moreover, sentiment analysis can be used in various other domains, such as economics, commerce and opinion mining to collect data for obtaining meaningful information. In this study, our major goal is to investigate the positive/negative polarity of Turkish Twitter feeds by using text classification methods for sentiment analysis. Bag of Words and N-Gram models are used to extract the content of text in feature extraction phase. Different similarity metrics are analyzed toimprove the performance of the kNN classifier on both Reuters-8 and Turkish Twitter Feeds data. The Reuters-8 data used to analyze effect of text language and length on classfication results. The experiments are conducted on six different combinations of feature extraction models and weighting methods. Experimental results show that IT-Sim gives better performance compared to other classification metrics and Tf-Idf is the most effective weighting method. The accuracy of the kNN classifier is depended on combination feature extraction model with different weighting methods and the values of k parameter.

AB  - Could Social Media, and in particular, microblogs such as Twitter, play a part in helping to track criminal movement? The aim of this paper is to narrow the focus of this broader problem of using social media to crowdsource information to assist in the fight against crime, to the specific problem of identifying the description of vehicles in microblog text. As this problem has many aspects, especially in terms of data gathering and identification, an initial search is performed on preset keywords and the resulting database is tagged. The tags are then analysed to determine which features are the most common. Topic models are then run on the data to determine if any useful keyword can be found for further searches and initial statistics are recorded as a baseline for further processing. Our primary concern is establishing the common content of the relevant Tweets. The result could be used both for help with data collection as well as with feature selection when learning classification algorithms for data mining.

Recently, with the development of mobile network and intelligent mobile phones, social media users play an important role of the evolution and management of a public safety event. One of the important functions of Weibo is to monitor real time public safety events, such as fire, explosion, traffic jam, etc. Weibo users can be seen as social sensors and Weibo can be seen as the sensor platform. In this paper, a crowdsensing based online attention computing method of public safety events is proposed. The proposed method contains three steps. First, a mobile crowdsensing based social media crawler is given. Second, spatial and temporal information is used to analyze the online attention of the public safety event. At last, the proposed model based online attention governance system is given. The system collected the online attention data from Weibo. Besides, given the Weibo posts related to a detected public safety event, the proposed method targets at mining the multi-modal information, as well as storytelling the online attention of the public safety event precisely and concisely. Extensive experiment studies on real-world microblog datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Case studies on real data sets show the proposed model has good performance and high effectiveness in the analysis of public safety events.

AB  - Social media is changing existing information behavior by giving users access to real-time online information channels without the constraints of time and space. Social media, therefore, has created an enormous data analysis challenge for scientists trying to keep pace with developments in their field. Most previous studies have adopted broad-brush approaches that typically result in limited analysis possibilities. To address this problem, we applied text-mining techniques to Twitter data related to the 2012 Korean presidential election. We use three primary techniques: topic modeling to track changes in topical trends, mention-direction-based user network analysis, and term co-occurrence retrieval for further content analysis. Our study reveals that Twitter could be a useful way to detect and trace the advent of and changes in social issues, while analyzing mention-based user networks could show different aspects of user behaviors.

AB  - Social media has substantially changed the way organizations, communities, and individuals communicate. However, the existing studies do not mention how the knowledge hidden in the gigantic volume of collected data would be found out. Efficient mining methods for social data stream are therefore still in great demand, especially for sharing common information among different services. In this paper, we propose an algorithm composed with FP-tree and LRU structure to discover frequent rules from the social media streaming environment. In the results of the performance evaluation, the runtime of UPTree is faster than existing FP-tree based approach (average 60%) on SNS environment.

AB  - A growing body of literature in social science has been devoted to extracting new information from social media to assist authorities in manage crowd projects. In this paper geolocation (or spatial) based information provided in social media is investigated to utilize intelligent transportation services. Further, the general trend of travel activities during weekdays is studied. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tweets in south and west part of the Sydney metropolitan area is utilized. After a data processing effort, the tweets are clustered into seven main categories using text mining techniques, where each category represents a type of activity including shopping, recreation, and work. Unlike the previous studies in this area, the focus of this work is on the content of the tweets rather than only using geotagged data or sentiment analysis. Beside activity type, temporal and spatial distributions of activities are used in the classification exercise. Categories are mapped to the identified regions within the city of Sydney across four time slots (two peak periods and two off-peak periods). Each time slot is used to construct a network with nodes representing people, activities and locations and edges reflecting the association between the nodes. The constructed networks are used to study the trend of activities/locations in a typical working day.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest growing areas which uses the natural language processing, text mining and computational linguistic to extract useful information to help in the decision making process. In the recent years, social media websites have been spreading widely, and their users are increasing rapidly. Automotive industry is one of the largest economic sectors in the world with more than 90 million cars and vehicles. Automotive industry is highly competitive and requires that sellers, automotive companies, carefully analyze and attend to consumers' opinions in order to achieve a competitive advantage in the market. Analysing consumers' opinions using social media data can be very great way for the automotive companies to enhance their marketing targets and objectives. In this paper, a sentiment analyses on a case study in the automotive industry is presented. Text mining and sentiment analysis are used to analyze unstructured tweets on Twitter to extract the polarity, and emotions classification towards the automotive classes such as Mercedes, Audi and BMW. We can note from the emotions classification results that, “joy” category is better for BMW comparing to Mercedes and Audi, The “sadness” percentage is larger for Audi and Mercedes comparing to BMW. Furthermore, we can note from the polarity classification that BMW has 72% positive tweets compared 79% for Mercedes and 83% for Audi. In addition, the results show that BMW has 8% negative polarity compared 18% for Mercedes and 16% for Audi.

AB  - The Internet shows more about information sharing, communication and freedom from Web to Web 2.0. However, there are challenges on the monitoring the influence structure of the negligible individuals on the web. This paper defines the ¿close relationship¿ between social individuals hidden in variety of communication medias of Internet, designs a novel intelligent association relation mining mechanism for removing the fault influence of non-valuable high frequency to improve the information quality measure of the ¿close relationship¿; also, this paper introduces Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) to explore the power of the influence, the central figures and their close relationships, to discover the pattern and channel for information flow between the social individuals in the network. The model is suitable to relation structure mining in many kinds of networks and medias and to reveal the important relations and their influences in the virtual networks. The experiments on the original data show that the feasibility of the whole model in this paper is satisfactory.

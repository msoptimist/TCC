    Abstract
    Purpose

    In this chapter, we explore the changing role of social media and its increasing influence in the recruitment and selection process. Access to social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn as profiling tools both inside and outside the workplace is generating a number of potential ethical, legal, and moral dilemmas in the human resource management (HRM) field.
    Methodology/approach

    This is a conceptual chapter which analyzed peer-reviewed academic literature, the business press, and other media outlets.
    Findings

    This conceptual chapter outlines the key issues for HR academics and professionals in the area of recruitment and selection associated with the changing role of social media in the workplace, and how it indirectly affects a number of other HR practices. Certain emergent practices such as cyber-vetting and applicant data mining demonstrate a deficiency in moral, ethical, and legal frameworks. The lack of attention paid to these new HR risks highlight the skill gap within the HR profession to handle information and data security challenges, any of which can be exacerbated due to social media.
    Practical implications

    In order to assist HR in tackling these challenges, we conclude with a number of recommendations for HR practitioners.
    Social implications

    The chapter helps raise awareness and understanding of this new and emerging aspect of digital HRM.
    Originality/value of the chapter

    We provide a framework for a broader understanding of the issues associated with cyber-vetting and its potential impact on HRM policies and practices.

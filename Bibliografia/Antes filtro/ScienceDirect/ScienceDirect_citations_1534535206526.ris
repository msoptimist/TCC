AB  - Cities are complex systems, where related Human activities are increasingly difficult to explore within. In order to understand urban processes and to gain deeper knowledge about cities, the potential of location-based social networks like Twitter could be used a promising example to explore latent relationships of underlying mobility patterns. In this paper, we therefore present an approach using a geographic self-organizing map (Geo-SOM) to uncover and compare previously unseen patterns from social media and authoritative data. The results, which we validated with Live Traffic Disruption (TIMS) feeds from Transport for London, show that the observed geospatial and temporal patterns between special events (r=0.73), traffic incidents (r=0.59) and hazard disruptions (r=0.41) from TIMS, are strongly correlated with traffic-related, georeferenced tweets. Hence, we conclude that tweets can be used as a proxy indicator to detect collective mobility events and may help to provide stakeholders and decision makers with complementary information on complex mobility processes.

AB  - The proliferation of Big Data & Analytics in recent years has compelled marketing practitioners to search for new methods when faced with assessing brand performance during brand equity appraisal. One of the challenges of current practices is that these methods rely heavily on traditional data collection and analysis methods such as questionnaires, and face to face or telephone interviews, which have a significant time lag. In this paper we introduce a computational model that combines topic and sentiment classification to elicit influential subjects from consumer perceptions in social media. Our model devises a novel genetic algorithm to improve clustering of tweets in semantically coherent groups, which act as an essential prerequisite when searching for prevailing topics and sentiment in big pools of data. To illustrate the validity of our model, we apply it to the Uber transportation network, from data collected through Twitter for the period between January and April 2015. The results obtained present consumer perceptions and produce insights for two fundamental brand equity dimensions: brand awareness and brand meaning. Simultaneously, they improve clustering results, in comparison to the k-means approach.

AB  - Nowadays, online social media is online discourse where people contribute to create content, share it, bookmark it, and network at an impressive rate. The faster message and ease of use in social media today is Twitter. The messages on Twitter include reviews and opinions on certain topics such as movie, book, product, politic, and so on. Based on this condition, this research attempts to use the messages of twitter to review a movie by using opinion mining or sentiment analysis. Opinion mining refers to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text mining to identify or classify whether the movie is good or not based on message opinion. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is supervised learning methods that analyze data and recognize the patterns that are used for classification. This research concerns on binary classification which is classified into two classes. Those classes are positive and negative. The positive class shows good message opinion; otherwise the negative class shows the bad message opinion of certain movies. This justification is based on the accuracy level of SVM with the validation process uses 10-Fold cross validation and confusion matrix. The hybrid Partical Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to improve the election of best parameter in order to solve the dual optimization problem. The result shows the improvement of accuracy level from 71.87% to 77%.

AB  - This paper aims to create an expert system that yields an optimal strategy for increasing network size on Facebook. Data were obtained from 5488 Facebook users by means of a custom-built Facebook application. We computed a total of 426 variables. Using these data we estimated a predictive model of network size which is subsequently used in a prescriptive model. The former is estimated with Random Forest and the latter with a Genetic Algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed expert system can identify an optimal social media strategy. The system delivers concrete recommendations about, for example, the optimal time between status updates. The analysis reveals that network size can be increased by 61% if the optimal strategy is adopted. This study contributes to literature in the following two ways. First it devises a novel prescriptive social media expert system relying on an unprecedented variety of social media data. The results indicate that the system is effective and a viable strategic tool for increasing network size. Second it provides a list of the top drivers allowing future research to build similar systems efficiently.

AB  - Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have been developing rapidly as a powerful and general learning approach which has been used successfully to find a reasonable solution for data mining and knowledge discovery. Genetic algorithm (GA) is a kind of mainstream EA paradigm with a purpose of developing solutions for optimization problems. Clustering ensembles have emerged as an outstanding algorithm in machine learning to leverage the consensus across multiple clustering solutions and combines their predictions into a single solution with improved robustness, stability and accuracy. Multimedia advancement and popularity of the social Web has collectively provided an easy way to generate bulk of videos. Categorization of such Web videos has become a hot research challenge. In this paper, we propose a Semi-supervised Evolutionary Ensemble (SS-EE) framework for social media mining, e.g., Web Video Categorization (WVC), using their low cost textual features, intrinsic relations and extrinsic Web support. The contributions of this research work are as follows. First, we extend the traditional Vector Space Model (VSM) to Semantic VSM (S-VSM) by considering the semantic similarity between the feature terms using Normalized Google Distance (NGD) approach. Second, we define a new distance measure, Triangular Similarity (TrS) between two Textual Feature Vectors (TFV) based on the frequencies of most relevant terms in each category. Third, we iterate the clustering ensemble process with the help of GA guided by a new measure, Pre-Paired Percentage (PPP), to be used as the fitness function during the genetic cycle. Fourth, in the key steps of the GA, crossover and mutation genetic operators, we define them by an intelligent mechanism of clustering ensemble. Fifth, in order to terminate the genetic cycle, we define another new measure, Clustering Quality (Cq), based on similarity matrix and clustering labels. Experiments on real world social-Web data (YouTube) have been performed to validate the SS-EE framework.

AB  - Communities can intuitively be defined as subsets of nodes of a graph with a dense structure in the corresponding subgraph. However, for mining such communities usually only structural aspects are taken into account. Typically, no concise nor easily interpretable community description is provided. For tackling this issue, this paper focuses on description-oriented community detection using subgroup discovery. In order to provide both structurally valid and interpretable communities we utilize the graph structure as well as additional descriptive features of the graph’s nodes. A descriptive community pattern built upon these features then describes and identifies a community, i.e., a set of nodes, and vice versa. Essentially, we mine patterns in the “description space” characterizing interesting sets of nodes (i.e., subgroups) in the “graph space”; the interestingness of a community is evaluated by a selectable quality measure. We aim at identifying communities according to standard community quality measures, while providing characteristic descriptions of these communities at the same time. For this task, we propose several optimistic estimates of standard community quality functions to be used for efficient pruning of the search space in an exhaustive branch-and-bound algorithm. We demonstrate our approach in an evaluation using five real-world data sets, obtained from three different social media applications.

AB  - Urban areas of interest (AOI) refer to the regions within an urban environment that attract people's attention. Such areas often have high exposure to the general public, and receive a large number of visits. As a result, urban AOI can reveal useful information for city planners, transportation analysts, and location-based service providers to plan new business, extend existing infrastructure, and so forth. Urban AOI exist in people's perception and are defined by behaviors. However, such perception was rarely captured until the Social Web information technology revolution. Social media data record the interactions between users and their surrounding environment, and thus have the potential to uncover interesting urban areas and their underlying spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents a coherent framework for extracting and understanding urban AOI based on geotagged photos. Six different cities from six different countries have been selected for this study, and Flickr photo data covering these cities in the past ten years (2004–2014) have been retrieved. We identify AOI using DBSCAN clustering algorithm, understand AOI by extracting distinctive textual tags and preferable photos, and discuss the spatiotemporal dynamics as well as some insights derived from the AOI. An interactive prototype has also been implemented as a proof-of-concept. While Flickr data have been used in this study, the presented framework can also be applied to other geotagged photos.

SA is a method for automatically mining the attitude of the author (or more generally the source) about a thought, behaviour, service or product. For this case, we have conducted SA in the context of Entrepreneurship and Innovativeness. We used random related university's official twitter account's followers to form a database for user names. Selection of followers and number of followers for university was made randomly. We have used 13.007 tweets that contain “entrepreneur” keyword and 14.579 tweets that contain “Innovation” keyword to identify the relevant class and #OezgecanAslan and #SevgiNeydi trend topic's tweets for irrelevant class and with this way we generate a lexicon about entrepreneurship and innovation for SA. In this generation phase we have used Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes Classifier data mining algorithms. We have performed SA on the approximately 1.353.803 tweets of 57.321 followers of 50 universities of interested and we obtain a new ranking of these. Finally we have conducted statistical tests for compatibility of these two university rankings.

In this work, we explore how social media data can be used to infer knowledge about urban dynamics and mobility patterns in a urban area. Specifically, in order to highlight the main advantages, limitations, and open issues, we focus on mobility patterns by presenting a survey of the state of the art and a case-study based on the city of Barcelona.

AB  - The recent decades have witnessed an unprecedented expansion in the volume of unstructured data in digital textual formats. Companies are now starting to recognize the potential economic value lying untapped in their text data repositories and sources, including external ones, such as social media platforms, and internal ones, such as safety reports and other company-specific document collections. Information extracted from these textual data sources is valuable for a range of enterprise application and for informed decision making. In this article we provide a systematic review of the current state of the art in the application of text analytics in industry. Our review is structured along three dimensions: the application context, the methods and techniques utilized, and the evaluation procedure. Based on the review, we identify the different challenges and constraints that an real-world, industrial environment imposes on text analytics techniques, as opposed to their deployment in more controlled, research environments. In addition, we formulate a set of desiderata that text analytics techniques should satisfy in order to alleviate these challenges and to ensure their successful deployment in industry. Furthermore, we discuss future trends in text analytics and their potential application in industry.

AB  - The Internet has provided people with new ways of expressing not only their individuality but also their collectivity i.e., their group affiliations. These group identities are the shared sense of belonging to a group. Online contact with others who share the same group identity can lead to cooperation and, even, coordination of social action initiatives both online and offline. Such social actions may be for the purposes of positive change, e.g., the Arab Spring in 2010, or disruptive, e.g., the England Riots in 2011. Stylometry and authorship attribution research has shown that it is possible to distinguish individuals based on their online language. In contrast, this work proposes and evaluates a model to analyse group identities online based on textual conversations amongst groups. We argue that textual features make it possible to automatically distinguish between different group identities and detect whether group identities are salient (i.e., most prominent) in the context of a particular conversation. We show that the salience of group identities can be detected with 95% accuracy and group identities can be distinguished from others with 84% accuracy. We also identify the most relevant features that may enable mal-actors to manipulate the actions of online groups. This has major implications for tools and techniques to drive positive social actions online or safeguard society from disruptive initiatives. At the same time, it poses privacy challenges given the potential ability to persuade or dissuade large groups online to move from rhetoric to action.

AB  - Supervised learning has attracted much attention in recent years. As a consequence, many of the state-of-the-art algorithms are domain dependent as they require a labeled training corpus to learn the domain features. This requires the availability of labeled corpora which is a cumbersome task in itself. However, for text sentiment detection SentiWordNet (SWN) may be used. It is a vocabulary where terms are arranged in synonym groups called synsets. This research makes use of SentiWordNet and treats it as the labeled corpus for training. A sentiment dictionary, SentiMI, builds upon the mutual information calculated from these terms. A complete framework is developed by using feature selection and extracting mutual information, from SentiMI, for the selected features. Training, testing and evaluation of the proposed framework are conducted on a large dataset of 50,000 movie reviews. A notable performance improvement of 7% in accuracy, 14% in specificity, and 8% in F-measure is achieved by the proposed framework as compared to the baseline SentiWordNet classifier. Comparison with the state-of-the-art classifiers is also performed on widely used Cornell Movie Review dataset which also proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The 12-month discussion surrounding a regional university campus quickly evolved from a suggestion of independence, to a plan, to the ultimate closure of the university. This unique series of events at the University of South Florida Polytechnic (USFP) allows for an investigation of how various forms of media were used during this significant event that impacted college student’s education and immediate future. A campus wide survey was combined with social and online media monitoring to assess the topics, authors, and methods used during prominent discussions during and preceding the closure of USFP. Although social media played a crucial role, the most common format was Twitter and it was used almost exclusively by members of the media itself. Students instead relied on traditional sources to gather information. Additionally, students expressed their opinion utilizing classic methods, such as petitions, foregoing more modern Twitter or Facebook campaigns. It is incorrect to automatically assume younger demographic authorship or utilization of social media technology. Whereas social media use could expand even more over the next decade, identifying authorship remains critical as it is unclear how frequent social media is viewed as an official method of public discussion, especially when politics and higher education collide.

AB  - The Web is evolving through an era where the opinions of users are getting increasingly important and valuable. The distillation of knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding, product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data. A recent knowledge-based technology in this context is sentic computing, which relies on the ensemble application of common-sense computing and the psychology of emotions to infer the conceptual and affective information associated with natural language. Sentic computing, however, is limited by the richness of the knowledge base and by the fact that the bag-of-concepts model, despite more sophisticated than bag-of-words, misses out important discourse structure information that is key for properly detecting the polarity conveyed by natural language opinions. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm to concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of each concept within the sentence and, hence, obtain a polarity detection engine that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods.

AB  - It is challenging to understand the latest trends and summarise the state or general opinions about products due to the big diversity and size of social media data, and this creates the need of automated and real time opinion extraction and mining. Mining online opinion is a form of sentiment analysis that is treated as a difficult text classification task. In this paper, we explore the role of text pre-processing in sentiment analysis, and report on experimental results that demonstrate that with appropriate feature selection and representation, sentiment analysis accuracies using support vector machines (SVM) in this area may be significantly improved. The level of accuracy achieved is shown to be comparable to the ones achieved in topic categorisation although sentiment analysis is considered to be a much harder problem in the literature.

AB  - Online media, such as blogs and social networking sites, generate massive volumes of unstructured data of great interest to analyze the opinions and sentiments of individuals and organizations. Novel approaches beyond Natural Language Processing are necessary to quantify these opinions with polarity metrics. So far, the sentiment expressed by emojis has received little attention. The use of symbols, however, has boomed in the past four years. About twenty billion are typed in Twitter nowadays, and new emojis keep appearing in each new Unicode version, making them increasingly relevant to sentiment analysis tasks. This has motivated us to propose a novel approach to predict the sentiments expressed by emojis in online textual messages, such as tweets, that does not require human effort to manually annotate data and saves valuable time for other analysis tasks. For this purpose, we automatically constructed a novel emoji sentiment lexicon using an unsupervised sentiment analysis system based on the definitions given by emoji creators in Emojipedia. Additionally, we automatically created lexicon variants by also considering the sentiment distribution of the informal texts accompanying emojis. All these lexica are evaluated and compared regarding the improvement obtained by including them in sentiment analysis of the annotated datasets provided by Kralj Novak, Smailovic, Sluban and Mozetic (2015). The results confirm the competitiveness of our approach.

AB  - The global digital economy tends to grow up through the adoption of key technologies, mobility, cloud computing, data mining, artificial intelligence or the extension of social environments. These influences turns up the economy and give rise to new tendencies for obtaining the value. The e-business and e-government strategy is not an easy to organize, although in terms of a fundamental strategy of e-business will be led by the super-expansion of the market. For this reason, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the implications that social media has in the development of electronic business (e-business) and to provide, through a mode, a viable solution to companies or even Governments. We defined a formal setting and have proposed a suite of software architectures with which we can obtain data entry in e-Governance models, that are exemplified in a case study.

AB  - Citizens are actively interacting with their surroundings, especially through social media. Not only do shared posts give important information about what is happening (from the users’ perspective), but also the metadata linked to these posts offer relevant data, such as the GPS-location in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs). In this paper we introduce a global analysis of the geo-tagged posts in social media which supports (i) the detection of unexpected behavior in the city and (ii) the analysis of the posts to infer what is happening. The former is obtained by applying density-based clustering techniques, whereas the latter is consequence of applying content aggregation techniques. We have applied our methodology to a dataset obtained from Instagram activity in New York City for seven months obtaining promising results. The developed algorithms require very low resources, being able to analyze millions of data-points in commodity hardware in less than one hour without applying complex parallelization techniques. Furthermore, the solution can be easily adapted to other geo-tagged data sources without extra effort.

AB  - Social media has become the largest data source of public opinion. The application of sentiment analysis to social media texts has great potential, but faces great challenges because of domain heterogeneity. Sentiment orientation of words varies by content domain, but learning context-specific sentiment in social media domains continues to be a major challenge. The language domain poses another challenge since the language used in social media today differs significantly from that used in traditional media. To address these challenges, we propose a method to adapt existing sentiment lexicons for domain-specific sentiment classification using an unannotated corpus and a dictionary. We evaluate our method using two large developing corpora, containing 743,069 tweets related to the stock market and one million tweets related to political topics, respectively, and five existing sentiment lexicons as seeds and baselines. The results demonstrate the usefulness of our method, showing significant improvement in sentiment classification performance.

AB  - The summarization is desirable to efficiently apprehend the gist of the huge amount of data and becomes a significant challenge in many applications such as news article summarization and social media mining. Considering the summaries from multi-documents of one topic can describe various aspects of one given topic, this paper attempts to exploit appropriate priors to generate topic aspect-oriented summarization (abbreviated as TAOS). The underlying intuition of the proposed TAOS is that different topics can prefer different aspects and the different aspects can be represented by different preference of features(e.g., technical topic may prefer proper noun than sports topic). In order to materialize the intuition of TAOS, we first extract several groups of features according to topic factors, and then a group norm penalty (i.e., ℓ1/ℓ2 norm) and latent variables are utilized to select overlapping groups of features. We compare our proposed approach with some state-of-the-art methods on DUC2003, DUC2004 datasets for text summarization and NUS-Wide dataset for image summarization. The results show our method can generate meaningful summarization in terms of ROUGE and Jensen–Shannon Divergence metrics.

AB  - This paper investigates the correlation between mutual funds׳ scale and return in China by text mining on the sheer volume of online financial reports. We crawl the webpages of all Chinese open-end mutual funds from a well-known financial website, which are then parsed to obtain time-series data of fund scales and returns. We argue that with long-tail distribution of fund scales, to examine the correlation directly in an individual level is not appropriate; rather, we should consider it in a group level by scales and take different market conditions into consideration. To illustrate this, we start with a data-fitting test to demonstrate that the tail of fund scale fits best in a distribution between Power-Law and Log-Normal. Hence, to categorize mutual funds by equal scale could lead to fund groups in substantially different sizes, and the subsequent results are thus prone to bias. We therefore introduce K-means clustering for fund categorization, which enables reliable examination of correlations between fund scale and return. Empirical study unveils some interesting findings on the scale effect of funds under different market conditions. These findings highlight the uniqueness of emerging markets while providing interesting guidelines for exploiting big data analytics for financial studies.

AB  - Social networks play an increasingly important role in shaping the behaviour of users of the Web. Conceivably Twitter stands out from the others, not only for the platform's simplicity but also for the great influence that the messages sent over the network can have. The impact of such messages determines the influence of a Twitter user and is what tools such as Klout, PeerIndex or TwitterGrader aim to calculate. Reducing all the factors that make a person influential into a single number is not an easy task, and the effort involved could become useless if the Twitter users do not know how to improve it. In this paper we identify what specific actions should be carried out for a Twitterer to increase their influence in each of above-mentioned tools applying, for this purpose, data mining techniques based on classification and regression algorithms to the information collected from a set of Twitter users.

AB  - Social media and mobile devices have revolutionized the way people communicate and share information in various contexts, such as in cities. In today’s “smart” cities, massive amounts of multiple forms of geolocated content is generated daily in social media, out of which knowledge for social interactions and urban dynamics can be derived. This work addresses the problem of detecting urban social activity patterns and interactions, by modeling cities into “dynamic areas”, i.e., coherent geographic areas shaped through social activities. Social media users provide the information on such social activities and interactions in cases when they are on the move around the city neighborhoods. The proposed approach models city places as feature vectors which represent users visiting patterns (social activity), the time of observed visits (temporal activity), and the context of functionality of visited places category. To uncover the dynamics of city areas, a clustering approach is proposed which considers the derived feature vectors to group people’s activities with respect to location, time, and context. The proposed methodology has been implemented on the DynamiCITY platform which demonstrates neighborhood analytics via a Web interface that allows end-users to explore neighborhoods dynamics and gain insights for city cross-neighborhood patterns and inter-relationships.

AB  - The effectiveness of traditional incident detection is often limited by sparse sensor coverage, and reporting incidents to emergency response systems is labor-intensive. We propose to mine tweet texts to extract incident information on both highways and arterials as an efficient and cost-effective alternative to existing data sources. This paper presents a methodology to crawl, process and filter tweets that are accessible by the public for free. Tweets are acquired from Twitter using the REST API in real time. The process of adaptive data acquisition establishes a dictionary of important keywords and their combinations that can imply traffic incidents (TI). A tweet is then mapped into a high dimensional binary vector in a feature space formed by the dictionary, and classified into either TI related or not. All the TI tweets are then geocoded to determine their locations, and further classified into one of the five incident categories. We apply the methodology in two regions, the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Metropolitan Areas. Overall, mining tweets holds great potentials to complement existing traffic incident data in a very cheap way. A small sample of tweets acquired from the Twitter API cover most of the incidents reported in the existing data set, and additional incidents can be identified through analyzing tweets text. Twitter also provides ample additional information with a reasonable coverage on arterials. A tweet that is related to TI and geocodable accounts for approximately 5% of all the acquired tweets. Of those geocodable TI tweets, 60–70% are posted by influential users (IU), namely public Twitter accounts mostly owned by public agencies and media, while the rest is contributed by individual users. There is more incident information provided by Twitter on weekends than on weekdays. Within the same day, both individuals and IUs tend to report incidents more frequently during the day time than at night, especially during traffic peak hours. Individual tweets are more likely to report incidents near the center of a city, and the volume of information significantly decays outwards from the center.

AB  - With the explosion of Social media, Opinion mining has been used rapidly in recent years. However, a few studies focused on the precision rate of feature review’s and opinion word’s extraction. These studies do not come with any optimum mechanism of supplying required precision rate for effective opinion mining. Most of these studies are based on Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and classical ontology. These systems are still imperfect for classifying the feature reviews into more degrees of polarity terms (strong negative, negative, neutral, positive and strong positive). Further, the existing classical ontology-based systems cannot extract blurred information from reviews; thus, it provides poor results. In this regard, this paper proposes a robust classification technique for feature review’s identification and semantic knowledge for opinion mining based on SVM and Fuzzy Domain Ontology (FDO). The proposed system retrieves a collection of reviews about hotel and hotel features. The SVM identifies hotel feature reviews and filter out irrelevant reviews (noises) and the FDO is then used to compute the polarity term of each feature. The amalgamation of FDO and SVM significantly increases the precision rate of review’s and opinion word’s extraction and accuracy of opinion mining. The FDO and intelligent prototype are developed using Protégé OWL-2 (Ontology Web Language) tool and JAVA, respectively. The experimental result shows considerable performance improvement in feature review’s classification and opinion mining.

AB  - The rapid damage assessment plays a critical role in crisis management. Collection of timely information for rapid damage assessment is particularly challenging during natural disasters. Remote sensing technologies were used for data collection during disasters. However, due to the large areas affected by major disasters such as Hurricane Matthew, specific data cannot be collected in time such as the location information. Social media can serve as a crowdsourcing platform for citizens’ communication and information sharing during natural disasters and provide the timely data for identifying affected areas to support rapid damage assessment during disasters. Nevertheless, there is very limited existing research on the utility of social media data in damage assessment. Even though some investigation of the relationship between social media activities and damages was conducted, the employment of damage-related social media data in exploring the fore-mentioned relationship remains blank. This paper, for the first time, establishes the index dictionary by semantic analysis for the identification of damage-related tweets posted during Hurricane Matthew in Florida. Meanwhile, the insurance claim data from the publication of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation is used as a representative of real hurricane damage data in Florida. This study performs a correlation analysis and a comparative analysis of the geographic distribution of social media data and damage data at the county level in Florida. We find that employing social media data to identify critical affected areas at the county level during disasters is viable. Damage data has a closer relationship with damage-related tweets than disaster-related tweets.

AB  - The use of social media has become an integral part of daily routine in modern society. Social media portals offer powerful public platforms where people can freely share their opinions and feelings about various topics with large crowds. In the current study, we investigated the public opinions and sentiments towards the Syrian refugee crisis, which has affected millions of people and has become a widely discussed, polarizing topic in social media around the world. To analyze public sentiments about the topic on Twitter, we collected a total of 2381,297 relevant tweets in two languages including Turkish and English. Turkish sentiments were considered important as Turkey has welcomed the largest number of Syrian refugees and Turkish tweets carried information to reflect public perception of a refugee hosting country first handedly. We performed a comparative sentiment analysis of retrieved tweets. The results indicated that the sentiments in Turkish tweets were significantly different from the sentiments in English tweets. We found that Turkish tweets carried slightly more positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees than neutral and negative sentiments, nevertheless the sentiments of tweets were almost evenly distributed among the three major categories. On the other hand, the largest number of English tweets by a significant margin contained neutral sentiments, which was followed by the negative sentiments. In comparison to the ratio of positive sentiments in Turkish tweets, 35% of all Turkish tweets, the proportion of English tweets contained remarkably less positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees, only 12% of all English tweets.

AB  - Background
Digital epidemiology tries to identify diseases dynamics and spread behaviors using digital traces collected via search engines logs and social media posts. However, the impacts of news on information-seeking behaviors have been remained unknown.
Methods
Data employed in this research provided from two sources, (1) Parsijoo search engine query logs of 48 months, and (2) a set of documents of 28 months of Parsijoo’s news service. Two classes of topics, i.e. macro-topics and micro-topics were selected to be tracked in query logs and news. Keywords of the macro-topics were automatically generated using web provided resources and exceeded 10k. Keyword set of micro-topics were limited to a numerable list including terms related to diseases and health-related activities. The tests are established in the form of three studies. Study A includes temporal analyses of 7 macro-topics in query logs. Study B considers analyzing seasonality of searching patterns of 9 micro-topics, and Study C assesses the impact of news media coverage on users’ health-related information-seeking behaviors.
Results
Study A showed that the hourly distribution of various macro-topics followed the changes in social activity level. Conversely, the interestingness of macro-topics did not follow the regulation of topic distributions. Among macro-topics, “Pharmacotherapy” has highest interestingness level and wider time-window of popularity. In Study B, seasonality of a limited number of diseases and health-related activities were analyzed. Trends of infectious diseases, such as flu, mumps and chicken pox were seasonal. Due to seasonality of most of diseases covered in national vaccination plans, the trend belonging to “Immunization and Vaccination” was seasonal, as well. Cancer awareness events caused peaks in search trends of “Cancer” and “Screening” micro-topics in specific days of each year that mimic repeated patterns which may mistakenly be identified as seasonality. In study C, we assessed the co-integration and correlation between news and query trends. Our results demonstrated that micro-topics sparsely covered in news media had lowest level of impressiveness and, subsequently, the lowest impact on users’ intents.
Conclusion
Our results can reveal public reaction to social events, diseases and prevention procedures. Furthermore, we found that news trends are co-integrated with search queries and are able to reveal health-related events; however, they cannot be used interchangeably. It is recommended that the user-generated contents and news documents are analyzed mutually and interactively.

AB  - With ubiquitous Internet access nowadays, individuals have the ability to share more information than before, and it allows young people to collaborate and learn from a distance, so that educational systems are constantly being reshaped. Understanding eLearn-ing is important, and so is the typology of students who participate in this trend with increasing dedication. Yet, we consider that this accelerated pace of propagation of online education has left behind an important aspect needed for the act of teaching, namely studying and understanding student archetypes. By this we mean the common patterns which define the interaction type, dedication amount, and finalization perspective of courses. This paper introduces an original set of student profiles specific to online courses, and it does so by means of data mining and supervised learning. We use the responses from an online questionnaire to gather detailed opinion from 632 students from Romania regarding the advantages and disadvantages of MOOCs, as well as the reasons for not joining online courses. Based on the extracted statistics, we present six decision trees for classifying the finalization and participation rates of online courses based on the students individual traits. Furthermore, we discuss these profiles and explain the implications of this study. We believe our findings to bring consistent novelty both in understanding the needs of modern students, as well as in optimizing the way eLearning is further developed.

AB  - Chinese microblogging is an increasingly popular social media platform. Accurately summarizing representative opinions from microblogs can increase understanding of the semantics of opinions. The unique challenges of Chinese opinion summarization in microblogging systems are automatic learning of important features and selection of representative sentences. Deep-learning methods can automatically discover multiple levels of representations from raw data instead of requiring manual engineering. However, there have been very few systematic studies on sentiment analysis of Chinese hot topics using deep-learning methods. Based on the latest deep-learning research, in this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based opinion summarization method for Chinese microblogging systems. The model first applies CNN to automatically mine useful features and perform sentiment analysis; then, by making good use of the obtained sentiment features, the semantic relationships among features are computed according to a hybrid ranking function; and finally, representative opinion sentences that are semantically related to the features are extracted using Maximal Marginal Relevance, which meets “relevant novelty” requirements. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the efficacy of the proposed model.

However, new tendencies in digital marketing are focusing on added interactivity, where the use of games as a marketing tool is not new. Moreover, the portion of population engaged in social networks is quickly increasing, turning these into preferred targets for marketing actions, considering the potential of retrieving valuable personal, demographic and geographic data. Forwarding recent advances in data mining and knowledge extraction to this model would therefore turn it into a powerful tool to measure the impact of marketing and branding actions, while reinforcing marketing strategy. In this paper we present GameFoundry, a new online platform that aims at creating an innovative Web Game Engine and Game Distribution system, which will provide support for knowledge management and game activity monitoring based on simple network games. It is intended to give the users the possibility of playing games in several environments, platforms and social networks, and to provide the clients of this product the ability to create, independently, a set of games with proprietary contents, distribute them over the network and have constant access to game activity, statistics and advanced user profiling, collective behavior and predictive models.

AB  - The rapid expansion in user-generated content on the Web of the 2000s, characterized by social media, has led to Web content featuring somewhat less standardized language than the Web of the 1990s. User creativity and individuality of language creates problems on two levels. The first is that social media text is often unsuitable as data for Natural Language Processing tasks such as Machine Translation, Information Retrieval and Opinion Mining, due to the irregularity of the language featured. The second is that non-native speakers of English, older Internet users and non-members of the “in-group” often find such texts difficult to understand. This paper discusses problems involved in automatically normalizing social media English, various applications for its use, and our progress thus far in a rule-based approach to the issue. Particularly, we evaluate the performance of two leading open source spell checkers on data taken from the microblogging service Twitter, and measure the extent to which their accuracy is improved by pre-processing with our system. We also present our database rules and classification system, results of evaluation experiments, and plans for expansion of the project.

AB  - In this digital era we are surrounded by social media applications and the hardware devices (such as sensorsetc) which are pouring data at an astonishing rate. This incoming data from heterogeneous sources is referred as data stream. Analysing data in motion (data streams) has become new challenge in order to meet the demands of real time analytics. Conventional mining techniques are proving inefficient since the behaviour of data itself has changed. Other challenges associated with data streams include resources constraints like memory and running time along with single scan of the data. Due to the time variant nature of data streams, applying any mining algorithm such as classification, clustering, indexing in a single scan of data is a tedious task. This paper focuses on concept drift problem in classification of streaming data. During classification a change in the concept or distribution of dataset over the time is termed as concept drift. The performance of a model/classifier degrades due to concept drift even in stationary data; dealing with this problem hence become more challenging in data streams. This paper presents categorization of existing streaming data classification algorithms along with their ability to solve concept drift problem. It also presents comparison of various tools available for simulating such problems along with their limitations. The paper also lists the various datasets and performance metrics that have been used in literature for performance analysis. Thus, this paper may serve as a complete roadmap for the researchers interested in designing new solutions for solving concept drift problem in streaming data classification. It also highlights the open research questions in this field.

AB  - The research described in this work focuses on identifying key components for the task of irony detection. By means of analyzing a set of customer reviews, which are considered ironic both in social and mass media, we try to find hints about how to deal with this task from a computational point of view. Our objective is to gather a set of discriminating elements to represent irony, in particular, the kind of irony expressed in such reviews. To this end, we built a freely available data set with ironic reviews collected from Amazon. Such reviews were posted on the basis of an online viral effect; i.e. contents that trigger a chain reaction in people. The findings were assessed employing three classifiers. Initial results are largely positive, and provide valuable insights into the subjective issues of language facing tasks such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining and decision making.

AB  - Twitter has emerged as a platform that is heavily used during disasters. Therefore, as an event unfolds, it generates varying levels of online engagement from victims as well as onlookers (both physical and virtual). Because methods for mining disaster-related content at scale must contend with the problem of filtering out vast numbers of unrelated posts, any prior knowledge about the characteristics of disaster-related content in the live Twitter feed may help improve the recovery of relevant posts. In this study, we consider the relative abundance of a disasters Twitter content over time (both relative to total event-related content and relative to the overall volume of content generated on Twitter). We refer to this time-varying abundance as the events signature. In an analysis of three different disasters, we find that event signatures are qualitatively different. These differences can be explained in terms of several characteristics of disasters: foreknowledge, duration, severity, and news media engagement.

AB  - This paper considers online news censorship and it concentrates on censorship of identities. Obfuscating identities may occur for disparate reasons, from military to judiciary ones. In the majority of cases, this happens to protect individuals from being identified and persecuted by hostile people. However, being the collaborative web characterised by a redundancy of information, it is not unusual that the same fact is reported by multiple sources, which may not apply the same restriction policies in terms of censorship. Also, the proven aptitude of social network users to disclose personal information leads to the phenomenon that comments to news can reveal the data withheld in the news itself. This gives us a mean to figure out who the subject of the censored news is. We propose an adaptation of a text analysis approach to unveil censored identities. The approach is tested on a synthesised scenario, which however resembles a real use case. Leveraging a text analysis based on a context classifier trained over snippets from posts and comments of Facebook pages, we achieve promising results. Despite the quite constrained settings in which we operate – such as considering only snippets of very short length – our system successfully detects the censored name, choosing among 10 different candidate names, in more than 50% of the investigated cases. This outperforms the results of two reference baselines. The findings reported in this paper, other than being supported by a thorough experimental methodology and interesting on their own, also pave the way for further investigation on the insidious issues of censorship on the web.

AB  - The deterioration in a corporation's profitability not only threatens its interests and sustainable development but also causes tremendous losses to other investors. Hence, constructing an effective pre-warning model for performance forecasting is an urgent requirement. Most previous studies only analyzed monetary-based ratios, but merely considering such ratios does not depict the full perspective of a corporation's business conditions. This study thus extends monetary-based ratios to non-monetary-based ratios and aggregates them through the analytic network process (ANP) with a risk-adjusted strategy to establish performance ranks of corporations. Analyzing a corporation's business relationships can help it to react to changes in the market and improve profit margins, as it draws upon such relationship networks for the transfer of scarce resources and knowledge. We believe that no current study adopts such a method to construct a forecasting model. To fill this gap in the literature, this study implements the social network (SN) technique to examine a corporation's competitive edge from seemingly noisy big media data, which are subsequently fed into an artificial intelligence (AI)-based technique to construct the model. The introduced model, examined through real-life cases under numerous conditions, offers a promising alternative for performance forecasting.

AB  - Background
Public and internet-based social media such as online healthcare-oriented chat groups provide a convenient channel for patients and people concerned about health to communicate and share information with each other. The chat logs of an online healthcare-oriented chat group can potentially be used to extract latent topics, to encourage participation, and to recommend relevant healthcare information to users.
Objective
This paper addresses the use of online healthcare chat logs to automatically discover both underlying topics and user interests.
Method
We present a new probabilistic model that exploits healthcare chat logs to find hidden topics and changes in these topics over time. The proposed model uses separate but associated hidden variables to explore both topics and individual interests such that it can provide useful insights to the participants of online healthcare chat groups about their interests in terms of weighted topics or vice versa.
Results
We evaluate the proposed model on a real-world chat log by comparing its performance to benchmark topic models, i.e., latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Author Topic Model (ATM), on the topic extraction task. The chat log is obtained from an online chat group of pregnant women, which consists of 233,452 chat word tokens contributed by 118 users. Both detected individual interests and underlying topics with their progressive information over time are demonstrated. The results show that the performance of the proposed model exceeds that of the benchmark models.
Conclusion
The experimental results illustrate that the proposed model is a promising method for extracting healthcare knowledge from social media data.

AB  - Large portion of product innovation and development is accomplished by customers and only a small segment of the customer population engages in such innovation activities. Empirical research has shown that users in this subgroup, called lead users, tend to experience needs before the rest of the marketplace and stand to benefit greatly by finding solutions to those needs. To meet the challenge of quickly and effectively identifying lead users and uncovering their innovation ideas, the authors propose a fast and systematic approach, called Fast Lead User IDentification (FLUID), utilizing data mining techniques to identify lead users on social networking sites. The paper describes the steps taken to build and optimize the FLUID system to effectively identify lead users on the micro-blogging site Twitter. This entails studies using validated lead user questionnaires resulting in clusters of lead and non-lead Twitter users for a single product. The gathered online user metadata and behavior are then used as training data for the automated system. An overview of data processing techniques and relations to the empirically derived lead user characteristics are presented. Finally, classification algorithms that help to separate lead users from non-lead users are discussed, including optimization leading to the validation of the proposed approach. By making use of data-mining techniques on data rich sites like social networking sites, the FLUID approach minimizes the resource and time costs in identifying lead users and this provides a step towards systematizing the fuzzy-front end of the new product development process.

AB  - Social media provides an environment of information exchange. They principally rely on their users to create content, to annotate others’ content and to make on-line relationships. The user activities reflect his opinions, interests, etc. in this environment. We focus on analysing this social environment to detect user interests which are the key elements for improving adaptation. This choice is motivated by the lack of information in the user profile and the inefficiency of the information issued from methods that analyse the classic user behaviour (e.g. navigation, time spent on web page, etc.). So, having to cope with an incomplete user profile, the user social network can be an important data source to detect user interests. The originality of our approach is based on the proposal of a new technique of interests' detection by analysing the accuracy of the tagging behaviour of a user in order to figure out the tags which really reflect the content of the resources. So, these tags are somehow comprehensible and can avoid tags “ambiguity” usually associated to these social annotations. The approach combines the tag, user and resource in a way that guarantees a relevant interests detection. The proposed approach has been tested and evaluated in the Delicious social database. For the evaluation, we compare the result issued from our approach using the tagging behaviour of the neighbours (the egocentric network and the communities) with the information yet known for the user (his profile). A comparative evaluation with the classical tag-based method of interests detection shows that the proposed approach is better.

AB  - In this paper, we exhibit how social media data can be used to detect and analyze real-word phenomena with several data mining techniques. We investigate the real-time flu detection problem and propose a flu state detection model with personal emotional factors and semantic information (Em-Flu model). First, we extract flu-related microblog posts automatically in real-time using a hybrid model composed by Support Vector Machine with features extracted from Restricted Boltzmann Machine. In order to overcome the limitation of 140 words for posts, expect for sentiment related features, association semantic rules are also adopted as additional features, such as bag of words, negative words, degree adverbs and sentiment words dictionary. For flu state detection at specific location, we propose an unsupervised model based on personal emotional factors to figure out what state of flu in specific place. For comparison, a supervised model is also built by adopting Conditional Random Fields to decide whether a poster has “really” catch flu and what influenza stage the poster is in. Some statistic methods and prior rules are adopted in supervised model to get the flu state of specific locations by counting the number of microblog posts in different flu states. By considering personal emotional factors, spatial features and temporal patterns of influenza, the performance of unsupervised and supervised models are both improved. The system could tell when and where influenza epidemic is more likely to occur at certain time in specific locations. In different experiments results, the hybrid models show robustness and effectiveness than state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised model only considering the number of posts.

We build a sentiment prediction model, including leading information, lagging information, and traditional post variables. We benchmark Random Forest and Support Vector Machines using five times twofold cross-validation. The results indicate that both leading and lagging information increase the model's predictive performance. The most important predictors include the number of uppercase letters, the number of likes and the number of negative comments. A higher number of uppercase letters and likes increases the likelihood of a positive post, while a higher number of comments increases the likelihood of a negative post. The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to assess the added value of leading and lagging information in the context of sentiment analysis.

AB  - As mobile technology and social media have advanced, companies have become more and more motivated to make use of social network services (SNS) such as Facebook to increase future firm performance. Perusing the literature on the association between SNS and firm performance, we found very few empirical studies of the comparative effect of company-driven activity (e.g. posting) and consumer-driven activity (e.g. liking, commenting, sharing) on firm performance. Moreover, specific SNS activities affecting firm performance in the present, future, or both have not been explicitly identified. Hence, we developed an empirical model to identify and find differences between the effects of SNS activities on firm performance in the present (as measured by returns on investment) or future (as measured by Tobin’s q) to improve our understanding of the impact of corporate SNS as a marketing channel. Text mining techniques are applied in this study to identify SNS activities from SNS data. The results suggest that SNS contributes significantly to future firm performance, as evidenced by increases in Tobin’s q. Moreover, company-driven activities affect future value, while consumer-driven activities affect present value. Implications from these results are discussed.

AB  - In recent years, we can easily observe that animations, comics, and games (ACG) have great output value and market influence on the entertainment and digit media market. The ACG industry is not an industry of a single country or region but a global industry. In addition to its own revenue, the derivative products (or licensed merchandise) of ACG can extend the ACG industry to win more business opportunities. The ACG industry is mainly marketed towards younger people, who are the major users of social network sites. Hence, the electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on social network sites often becomes a reference basis of the young people’s attitudinal acceptance and purchase intention in purchasing ACG-related derivative product. In this paper, we analyze the influential factors of positive eWOM’s communication motivations that affect consumer acceptance on social network sites, and apply the uncomplicated decision tree data mining algorithm to compute the association rules between these influential factors and consumer acceptance, expecting to understand the relationship between eWOM on social network sites and consumer acceptance. The results of this study can help the business decision-making in CRM and marketing of the industry of ACG-related derivative product. This study found that the degree of perception of ACG product and the degree of taking pleasure in sharing ACG-related information with others have a significant correlation with consumer acceptance.

AB  - With the rapid development of Web 2.0 applications, social media have increasingly become a major factor influencing the purchase decisions of customers. Longitudinal individual and engagement behavioral data generated on social media sites post challenges to integrate diverse heterogeneous data to improve prediction performance in customer response modeling. In this study, a hierarchical ensemble learning framework is proposed for behavior-aware user response modeling using diverse heterogeneous data. In the framework, a general-purpose data transformation and feature extraction strategy is developed to transform the heterogeneous high-dimensional multi-relational datasets into customer-centered high-order tensors and to extract attributes. An improved hierarchical multiple kernel support vector machine (H-MK-SVM) is developed to integrate the external, tag and keyword, individual behavioral and engagement behavioral data for feature selection from multiple correlated attributes and for ensemble learning in user response modeling. The subagging strategy is adopted to deal with large-scale imbalanced datasets. Computational experiments using a real-world microblog database were conducted to investigate the benefits of integrating diverse heterogeneous data. Computational results show that the improved H-MK-SVM using longitudinal individual behavioral data exhibits superior performance over some commonly used methods using aggregated behavioral data and the improved H-MK-SVM using engagement behavioral data performs better than using only the external and individual behavioral data.

AB  - There has been increasing concern in Australia in recent years over a potential disconnect between the value generated by the mining industry and the return to the local community. This research contributes to this debate by analysing the impacts of a large mining operation on the local communities in the Central West region of NSW in Australia. The research uses a qualitative framework based on a single case study: Newcrest Mining Limited. Major data sources include interviews with key stakeholders and content analysis of media reports and local press. The analysis employs a modified form of PESTEL framework as the analytical tool and NVivo for data analysis. The research revealed how engagement with local communities can improve the investment outcomes in a regional economy. Newcrest adopted a proactive approach from the very beginning. The study observed a very positive and healthy relationship between the company and the local communities in general. Newcrest is found to be a good corporate citizen and is performing well in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This case study analysis is significant as it is located in a regional area that is not considered to be remote and also not entirely dependent on mining operations economically.

AB  - Recently, businesses and research communities have paid a lot of attention to social media and big data. However, the field of supply chain management (SCM) has been relatively slow in studying social media and big data for research and practice. In these contexts, this research contributes to the SCM community by proposing a novel, analytical framework (Twitter Analytics) for analyzing supply chain tweets, highlighting the current use of Twitter in supply chain contexts, and further developing insights into the potential role of Twitter for supply chain practice and research. The proposed framework combines three methodologies – descriptive analytics (DA), content analytics (CA) integrating text mining and sentiment analysis, and network analytics (NA) relying on network visualization and metrics – for extracting intelligence from 22,399 #supplychain tweets. Some of the findings are: supply chain tweets are used by different groups of supply chain professionals and organizations (e.g., news services, IT companies, logistic providers, manufacturers) for information sharing, hiring professionals, and communicating with stakeholders, among others; diverse topics are being discussed, ranging from logistics and corporate social responsibility, to risk, manufacturing, SCM IT and even human rights; some tweets carry strong sentiments about companies׳ delivery services, sales performance, and environmental standards, and risk and disruption in supply chains. Based on these findings, this research presents insights into the use and potential role of Twitter for supply chain practices (e.g., professional networking, stakeholder engagement, demand shaping, new product/service development, supply chain risk management) and the implications for research. Finally, the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are presented.

AB  - Objectives
The emergence of social media technology has led to the creation of many online healthcare communities, where patients can easily share and look for healthcare-related information from peers who have experienced a similar problem. However, with increased user-generated content, there is a need to constantly analyse which content should be trusted as one sifts through enormous amounts of healthcare information. This study aims to explore patients’ healthcare information seeking behavior in online communities.
Methods
Based on dual-process theory and the knowledge adoption model, we proposed a healthcare information adoption model for online communities. This model highlights that information quality, emotional support, and source credibility are antecedent variables of adoption likelihood of healthcare information, and competition among repliers and involvement of recipients moderate the relationship between the antecedent variables and adoption likelihood. Empirical data were collected from the healthcare module of China’s biggest Q&A community—Baidu Knows. Text mining techniques were adopted to calculate the information quality and emotional support contained in each reply text. A binary logistics regression model and hierarchical regression approach were employed to test the proposed conceptual model.
Results
Information quality, emotional support, and source credibility have significant and positive impact on healthcare information adoption likelihood, and among these factors, information quality has the biggest impact on a patient’s adoption decision. In addition, competition among repliers and involvement of recipients were tested as moderating effects between these antecedent factors and the adoption likelihood. Results indicate competition among repliers positively moderates the relationship between source credibility and adoption likelihood, and recipients’ involvement positively moderates the relationship between information quality, source credibility, and adoption decision.
Conclusions
In addition to information quality and source credibility, emotional support has significant positive impact on individuals’ healthcare information adoption decisions. Moreover, the relationships between information quality, source credibility, emotional support, and adoption decision are moderated by competition among repliers and involvement of recipients.

In this research, we utilize a unique open dataset “The Global Data on Events, Location and Tone” (GDELT) to model the image of China in mass media, specifically, how China has related to the rest of the world and how this connection has evolved upon time. The results of this research contribute to both the methodological and the empirical perspectives: We examined the effectiveness of the dynamic time warping (DTW) distances in measuring the differences between long-term mass media data. We identified four types of connection strength patterns between China and its top 15 related countries. With that, the distance decay effect in mass media is also examined and compared with social media and public transportation data. While using multiple datasets and focusing on mass media, this study generates valuable input regarding the interpretation of the diplomatic and regional correlation for the nation of China. It also provides methodological references for investigating international relations in other countries and regions in the big data era.

AB  - Today social media websites have made the great success, which allow users to upload personal media data and encourage them to annotate media data with free tags. With the rich tags, users can more conveniently access the image content on these websites. However, the tags annotated by users are generally in a random order without recovering any important relevant information to the content of images. To target this issue, we propose a tags ranking scheme to automatically rank the tags with respect to given images by taking both their relevance to this image's visual content and their relationships into account. The proposed framework mainly comprises four stages. First, given a tag query, a set of web images is collected from multiple searching engines to cover the semantic space. Second, initial relevance scores of the tags with respect to a given image's visual content are estimated in Bayesian framework, in which a fused visual similarity is adopted through the linear combination of global and local visual similarities. Third, tags graph is constructed by mining the relationships among tags. At last, a random walk process over tags graph is performed to refine the tags ranking. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.

The dataset is from a two-year posting history of 18,333 unique posts, 113,621 likes, and 3401 comments. Less than a quarter of the libraries had more than 2000 post-related likes, and only seven received more than 100 comments on their postings. Content analysis identified the most prevalent single word (unigrams), bigrams (two-word sequences), and trigrams (three-word sequences) in high and low engagement content. Semantic analysis identified the semantic categories for posts with high and low engagement. The findings can assist academic libraries in their social media strategies for engagement, marketing, and visibility.

AB  - Social media provide a platform for users to express their opinions and share information. Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p<.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p<.0005), and diet and obesity (p<.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with “Diabetes”, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for “Diet” included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for “Exercise” included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for “Obesity” included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.

AB  - Objective
The rapid growth of online health social websites has captured a vast amount of healthcare information and made the information easy to access for health consumers. E-patients often use these social websites for informational and emotional support. However, health consumers could be easily overwhelmed by the overloaded information. Healthcare information searching can be very difficult for consumers, not to mention most of them are not skilled information searcher. In this work, we investigate the approaches for measuring user similarity in online health social websites. By recommending similar users to consumers, we can help them to seek informational and emotional support in a more efficient way.
Methods
We propose to represent the healthcare social media data as a heterogeneous healthcare information network and introduce the local and global structural approaches for measuring user similarity in a heterogeneous network. We compare the proposed structural approaches with the content-based approach.
Results
Experiments were conducted on a dataset collected from a popular online health social website, and the results showed that content-based approach performed better for inactive users, while structural approaches performed better for active users. Moreover, global structural approach outperformed local structural approach for all user groups. In addition, we conducted experiments on local and global structural approaches using different weight schemas for the edges in the network. Leverage performed the best for both local and global approaches. Finally, we integrated different approaches and demonstrated that hybrid method yielded better performance than the individual approach.
Conclusion
The results indicate that content-based methods can effectively capture the similarity of inactive users who usually have focused interests, while structural methods can achieve better performance when rich structural information is available. Local structural approach only considers direct connections between nodes in the network, while global structural approach takes the indirect connections into account. Therefore, the global similarity approach can deal with sparse networks and capture the implicit similarity between two users. Different approaches may capture different aspects of the similarity relationship between two users. When we combine different methods together, we could achieve a better performance than using each individual method.

AB  - With the speedy development of social media, more and more multimedia data are generated by users with tags associated. The tag information provides the extra cue to link multimedia data in addition to the multimedia content itself. However, the manually added tags are always with noise and not correct enough. Moreover, the semantically similar tags exist massively but cannot be accounted for well. This paper proposes a new algorithm to robustly combine multimedia content and associated tags by mining the latent semantic which takes into account the semantically similar tags. The l2,1 norm is proposed to employ in latent semantic indexing for a more robust latent space, and a word-to-vector based clustering method is proposed to address the massive tags with similar meaning. The experiments on extensive data demonstrate the proposed method. Compared to the existing latent semantic based methods, the algorithm proposed a more robust model to deal with noise.

AB  - The capability of identifying real-time customer needs is critical for manufacturers that provide short life cycle consumer products such as smart phones. Companies need to form research and development (R&D) strategies to improve key functional features for short lifespan products to reflect the adoption of innovative technologies and changing customer expectations. With the pervasive use of the Internet, this research crawls and analyzes the online voice of customers (VoC), overcoming the time lag of offline surveys, to identify and prioritize product functions for deployment using extended quality function deployment (eQFD) models. In this research, the novel analytics of the manufacturer’s patent portfolio is added as an additional eQFD dimension to map ranked functional improvements to a manufacturer’s R&D capabilities. Thus, a computer supported eQFD system is developed to perform the unique mappings and gap analyses between the VoC, the prioritized product functions, and the manufacturer’s patent portfolio. The newly developed eQFD methodology and its novel discoveries are demonstrated in detail using a case study of three smart phones launched during the same time frame. The products include the Samsung Galaxy S7, the Huawei Honor 5X, and the ASUS Zenfone 3. The newly developed methodology is generally applicable to support VoC-centric product function deployment and R&D strategic planning in other domains.

AB  - This study applies a text mining approach to a significant dataset of tweets by academic libraries. The dataset for this research was collected from the complete Twitter timelines of ten academic libraries. The total dataset comprised 23,707 tweets with 17,848 mentions, 7625 hashtags, and 5974 retweets. Academic libraries from the dataset have typically posted fewer than 50 tweets per month, though tweet volume grew rapidly in late-2013 through 2014. The results show variance between academic libraries in distribution of tweets over time. The most frequent word was “open,” which was used in a variety of contexts by the academic libraries. It was noted that the most frequent bi-gram (two-word sequence) in the aggregated tweets was “special collections”. The most frequent tri-gram (three-word sequence) was “save the date”. The most frequent word categories in the semantic analysis for most libraries were related to “knowledge, insight, and information concerning personal and cultural relations”. The most common category of the tweets was “Resources” among all the selected academic libraries. These findings highlight the importance of using data- and text-mining approaches in understanding the aggregate social data of academic libraries to aid in decision-making and strategic planning for patron outreach and marketing of services.

AB  - Social media data is notoriously noisy and unclean. Recipe collections and their manual categorization built by users are no exception. However, a consistent and transparent categorization is vital to users who search for a specific entry. Similarly, curators are faced with the same challenge given a large collection of existing recipes: They first need to understand the data to be able to build a clean system of categories. This paper presents an empirical study using machine learning classifiers (logistic regression and decision trees) for the automatic classification of recipes on the German cooking website Chefkoch.de. The central question we aim at answering is: Which information is necessary to perform well at this task? In particular, we compare features extracted from the free text instructions of the recipe to those taken from the list of ingredients. On a sample of 5000 recipes with 87 classes, our feature analysis shows that a combination of nouns from the textual description of the recipe with ingredient features performs best in the logistic regression model (48% F1). Nouns alone achieve 45% F1 and ingredients alone 46% F1. However, other word classes do not complement the information from nouns. Decision trees constantly underperform the logistic regression, however, lead to an interpretable model. On a bigger training set of 50,000 instances, the best configuration shows an improvement to 57% highlighting the importance of a sizeable data set. In addition, we report on the use of these feature vectors for similarity search and ranking of recipes and evaluate on the task of (near) duplicate detection. We show that our method can reduce the manual curation with precision@3 = 0.52.

AB  - Drug discovery is shifting focus from industry to outside partners and, in the process, creating new bottlenecks. Technologies like high throughput screening (HTS) have moved to a larger number of academic and institutional laboratories in the USA, with little coordination or consideration of the outputs and creating a translational gap. Although there have been collaborative public–private partnerships in Europe to share pharmaceutical data, the USA has seemingly lagged behind and this may hold it back. Sharing precompetitive data and models may accelerate discovery across the board, while finding the best collaborators, mining social media and mobile approaches to open drug discovery should be evaluated in our efforts to remove drug discovery bottlenecks. We describe four strategies to rectify the current unsustainable situation.

AB  - Abstract
Use of data generated through social media for health studies is gradually increasing. Twitter is a short-text message system developed 6 years ago, now with more than 100 million users generating over 300 million Tweets every day. Twitter may be used to gain real-world insights to promote healthy behaviors. The purposes of this paper are to describe a practical approach to analyzing Tweet contents and to illustrate an application of the approach to the topic of physical activity. The approach includes five steps: (1) selecting keywords to gather an initial set of Tweets to analyze; (2) importing data; (3) preparing data; (4) analyzing data (topic, sentiment, and ecologic context); and (5) interpreting data. The steps are implemented using tools that are publically available and free of charge and designed for use by researchers with limited programming skills. Content mining of Tweets can contribute to addressing challenges in health behavior research.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of photo and video sharing social networks, more and more people have shared their photos or videos with their family members and friends. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for recommending top-k tours to meet user's interest and time frame by using user-generated contents in a photo sharing social network. The proposed framework contains four phases. First, we cluster geotagged locations into landmarks, and further cluster these landmarks into areas by the mean-shift clustering method. Second, we employ the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to categorize the hashtags posted by users into landmark topics, and then use these topics to characterize landmarks and users. Third, to recommend tours for a user, we compute the tendency (or score) of the user visiting each landmark by the landmark popularity, the attraction of landmark to the user, and how many users similar to the user visit the landmark. Finally, based on the scores computed, we develop a method to recommend top-k tours with highest scores for the user. Unlike most previous methods recommending tours landmark by landmark, our framework recommends tours area by area so that users can avoid going back and forth from one area to another and save plenty of time on transportation, which in turn can visit more landmarks. The experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms the Markov-Topic method in terms of average score and precision. Our proposed framework may help users plan their trips and customize a trip for each user.

AB  - CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus (Cadec) is a new rich annotated corpus of medical forum posts on patient-reported Adverse Drug Events (ADEs). The corpus is sourced from posts on social media, and contains text that is largely written in colloquial language and often deviates from formal English grammar and punctuation rules. Annotations contain mentions of concepts such as drugs, adverse effects, symptoms, and diseases linked to their corresponding concepts in controlled vocabularies, i.e., SNOMED Clinical Terms and MedDRA. The quality of the annotations is ensured by annotation guidelines, multi-stage annotations, measuring inter-annotator agreement, and final review of the annotations by a clinical terminologist. This corpus is useful for studies in the area of information extraction, or more generally text mining, from social media to detect possible adverse drug reactions from direct patient reports. The corpus is publicly available at https://data.csiro.au.1The data can be used for research purposes only, under the CSIRO data licence.1

AB  - During the last ten years, a large body of research extracting and analysing geographic data from social media has developed. We analyse 690 papers across 20 social media platforms, focussing particularly on the method used for extraction of location information. We discuss and compare extraction methods, and consider their accuracy and coverage. While much work has adopted location information in the form of coordinates in message metadata, this approach has very limited coverage in most platforms and reports on posting location rather than message location or the location that the message refers to (geofocus). In contrast, a wide array of other approaches have been developed, with methods that extract place names from message text providing the highest accuracy. Methods that use social media connections also provide good results, but all of the methods have limitations. We also present analysis of the range and frequency of use of different social media platforms, and the wide range of application areas that have been addressed. Drawing on this analysis we present a number of future areas of research that warrant attention in order for this field of research to mature.

AB  - In the context of social media, users mutually share their interests of an event mentioned in a Web document. Its content can also be found in different news providers with a writing variation. This paper presents a framework which exploits the support of social context (user-generated content such as comments or tweets and third-party sources such as relevant documents retrieved from a search engine) to extract high-quality summaries. The extraction was formulated in two steps: sentence scoring and selection. The scoring is modeled as a learning to rank problem, which employs Ranking SVM to mutually exploits sentences, user-generated content, and third-party sources in the form of features to cover summary aspects. For the selection, summaries are extracted by using a score-based or voting method. For evaluation, three datasets of sentence and highlight extraction in two languages were taken as a case study. Experimental results indicate that by integrating user-generated content and third-party sources, our framework obtains improvements of ROUGE-scores over state-of-the-art methods for single-document summarization.

AB  - Grounded by the micro approach to network theory, information diffusion theory, and the web ecology model, this study comparatively explores the network structure, interaction pattern, and geographic distribution of users involved in communication networks of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Twitter and YouTube. The results show that Twitter users generated a loosely connected hub-and-spoke network, suggesting that information was likely to be organized by several central users in the network and that these users bridged small communities. On YouTube, homogeneously themed videos formed a dense mesh network, reinforcing shared ideas and meanings. According to the geographic distribution, both Twitter and YouTube networks were actively organized by U.S. users, but the YouTube network was activated mainly by anonymous users. These results highlight differing roles of social media in political information diffusion in which the Twitter network not only organizes and coordinates information but also facilitate the exchange of ideas between different groups. YouTube is suitable for disseminating ideas and reinforcing solidarity among members. The results demonstrate useful analytical techniques for data mining and analyzing Twitter and YouTube networks and have important implications for distinct roles of social media platforms in organizing collective action.

AB  - Harnessing the potential of new generation transport data and increasing public participation are high on the agenda for transport stakeholders and the broader community. The initial phase in the program of research reported here proposed a framework for mining transport-related information from social media, demonstrated and evaluated it using transport-related tweets associated with three football matches as case studies. The goal of this paper is to extend and complement the previous published studies. It reports an extended analysis of the research results, highlighting and elaborating the challenges that need to be addressed before a large-scale application of the framework can take place. The focus is specifically on the automatic harvesting of relevant, valuable information from Twitter. The results from automatically mining transport related messages in two scenarios are presented i.e. with a small-scale labelled dataset and with a large-scale dataset of 3.7m tweets. Tweets authored by individuals that mention a need for transport, express an opinion about transport services or report an event, with respect to different transport modes, were mined. The challenges faced in automatically analysing Twitter messages, written in Twitter’s specific language, are illustrated. The results presented show a strong degree of success in the identification of transport related tweets, with similar success in identifying tweets that expressed an opinion about transport services. The identification of tweets that expressed a need for transport services or reported an event was more challenging, a finding mirrored during the human based message annotation process. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of automatic extraction of valuable information from tweets while pointing to areas where challenges were encountered and additional research is needed. The impact of a successful solution to these challenges (thereby creating efficient harvesting systems) would be to enable travellers to participate more effectively in the improvement of transport services.

AB  - It is widely held that social media is a valuable source of information for responders to mass emergencies. However, little is known about how much useful situational information social media data streams contain and how this content varies across types of events. In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of the novel situational information provided by public Twitter posts produced during and immediately following three fundamentally different disasters: the 2012 Newtown Connecticut shooting, 2013 Moore tornado, and 2013 Alberta floods. Our analysis reveals that these events yield data streams that contain quite different types and amounts of situational information, generated by different kinds of individuals with varying relationships to the event of interest. Furthermore, we find that, across all events, event-specific hashtags are rarely used in tweets that carry novel information, suggesting that event-specific hashtag/keyword filters miss much novel information. Collectively, these findings highlight a number of factors that can inform how social media is used to facilitate response and recovery efforts for specific mass emergencies.

AB  - With the development of social media, online social networks offer potential opportunities for firms to analyze user behaviors. Among many, one of the fundamental questions is how to predict product adoption, and the answer to this question lays the foundation for product adoption maximization and demand estimation in large social networks. However, due to the inherent challenges resulting from the dynamic diffusion mechanism in online social networks, such as modeling of activation thresholds and influence probability, differentiating between influence and adoption, and incorporating review content, traditional diffusion models are often not adequate enough to predict product adoption accurately. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a linear threshold-hurdle model to predict product adoption incorporating social network effects. First, we present a fine-grained activation threshold model based on the five categories of adopters. In addition, we identify three operational factors underlying social network effects, including interaction strength, structural equivalence, and social entity similarity, to model influence probabilities. Furthermore, we distinguish influence spread from adoption spread by introducing a tattle state, in which users express opinions without adopting the product. Finally, we introduce the notion of hurdle to capture the monetary aspect in users’ decision making process of product adoption. Based on the proposed linear threshold-hurdle model, two data mining methods based on the rough set technique, namely, decision rules and decomposition trees, are employed to predict product adoption in a large social network. An empirical study of Kindle Fire HD 7in. tablets is used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed model. The results demonstrate the predictive power of the proposed model with average F-scores of 89.8% for the week prediction model and of 86.7% for the bi-week prediction model.

AB  - Nowadays, people are practicing physical exercise in order to maintain good health conditions. Such physical workouts are required by a plan, which should be designed and supervised by sport specialists and medical assistants. Thus, the exercise sessions shall start with consultation of a coach, doctor and dietician; however, many times this scenario is not presented. In typical activities such as running, cycling and fitness, people use health mobile apps with their smartphones, which offer support for these activities. Nevertheless, the functionality and operation of these applications are isolated, because many and long questionnaires are performed. Additionally, the physical and health state of a user is not considered. These issues would be taken into account for determining recommendations about the time for doing exercise and the kind of activity for each person. In this work, a social semantic mobile framework to generate recommendations where a mobile application allows sensing the physical performance, taking into consideration medical criteria with smartphones is proposed. The approach includes a semantic cross-information that comes from social network and official data as well as sport activities and medical knowledge. This knowledge is translated into application ontologies related directly to health, nutrition and training domains. The methodology also covers physical fitness tests and a monitoring tool for evaluating the nutrition plan and the correct execution of the training. As case study, the mobile application offers to evaluate the physical and health conditions of a runner, automatically generate a nutrition plan and training, monitor plans and recomputed them if users make changes in their routines. The data provided from the social network are used as feedback in the application, in order to make the training and nutrition plans more flexible by applying spatio-temporal analysis based on machine learning. Finally, the generated training and nutrition plans were validated by specialists, they have demonstrated 82% of effectiveness rate in exercise training routines and 86% in nutrition plans. In addition, the results were compared with isolated approaches and manual recommendations made by specialists, the obtained overall performance was 81%.

AB  - With an ever expanding content and user base, the Web presents information discovery and consumption challenges for both consumers and producers of information. Producers of information strive for visibility among consumers who have limited attention. Corporate websites are a primary digital marketing channel for firms through which they seek to gain a bigger share of their stakeholders' (i.e., customers, investors, communities) attention. Using observations spanning several years we study the website visibility, as measured by user traffic, of more than 2500 public firms and its association with properties of corporate websites and the corresponding firms. One property that is of particular interest to us is the availability of “community-engaging” pages, i.e., pages that support blogs or forums on the website or provide links to external social media platforms such as Facebook. These community-engaging pages signify online prosocial services provided by firms. We find that websites with larger number of community-engaging pages are associated with higher visibility. This provides a novel empirical support for the promotion and use of social media content and tools on websites of firms. We also find that websites with more specific content are associated with lower visibility while providing more out-links is associated with higher visibility. We observe these results consistently over time. These associations are observed while controlling for the size of the firms, types of their industries, the magnitude of media attention and other firm-level heterogeneity. Finally, machine learning models derived from our empirical analysis provide strong predictive utility for out-of-sample data.

We benchmark the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Stochastic Adaptive Boosting, Kernel Factory, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines using five times twofold cross-validation. The results indicate that it is feasible to create models with high predictive performance. The top performing algorithm was Stochastic Adaptive Boosting with a cross-validated AUC of 0.66 and accuracy of 0.74. The most important predictors include deviation from regular usage patterns, frequencies of likes of specific categories and group memberships, average photo album privacy settings, and recency of comments. Facebook and other social networks alike could use predictions of increases in usage frequency to customize its services such as pacing the rate of advertisements and friend recommendations, or adapting News Feed content altogether. The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to assess the prediction of increases in usage frequency in a social network.

AB  - In this paper we present a methodology to analyze and visualize streams of Social Media messages and apply it to a case in which Twitter is used as a backchannel, i.e. as a communication medium through which participants follow an event in the real world as it unfolds. Unlike other methods based on social networks or theories of information diffusion, we do not assume proximity or a pre-existing social structure to model content generation and diffusion by distributed users; instead we refer to concepts and theories from discourse psychology and conversational analysis to track online interaction and discover how people collectively make sense of novel events through micro-blogging. In particular, the proposed methodology extracts concept maps from twitter streams and uses a mix of sentiment and topological metrics computed over the extracted concept maps to build visual devices and display the conversational flow represented as a trajectory through time of automatically extracted topics. We evaluated the proposed method through data collected from the analysis of Twitter users’ reactions to the March 2015 Apple Keynote during which the company announced the official launch of several new products.

AB  - In the wake of political activism among youth in particular and the whole population in general, everyone is not only eager to share their political orientation but equally curious regarding the voice of the masses. As a known notion, the perfect orifice to this emerging need of political activism can be found on social media platforms, from where the numerous aspects of public opinion can be captured easily. These sites have begun to have a large impact on how people think and act. It is a known phenomenon that public opinion is the largest indicator of success and failure of political parties and is a direct reflection of the party's reign. Where increased sharing of public feedback has increased awareness and promoted accountability, it has also created chaos and confusion for many. Using Twitter, the most popular micro blogging platform, this paper aims to give a method to ease and smooth the task of opinion mining with the help of linguistic analysis and opinion classifiers, which will together determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments for the political parties of Pakistan. A method is provided which pre-processes the raw data of twitter and comparison of two classification techniques to classify this data. That will aspire to capture a snapshot of current political scenario to promote the spirit of accountability, self-analysis and improvement in among Pakistani politicians. Moreover, with this we aim to give general public an important consolidated voice in the realm of politics.

With the explosion of the abundant data present on social media, it has become important to analyze this text for seeking information and use it for the advantage of various applications and people. From past few years, this task of automatic summarization has stirred the interest among communities of Natural Language Processing and Text Mining, especially when it comes to opinion summarization. Opinions play a pivotal role in decision making in the society. Other's opinions and suggestions are the base for an individual or a company while making decisions. In this paper, we propose a graph based technique that generates summaries of redundant opinions and uses sentiment analysis to combine the statements. The summaries thus generated are abstraction based summaries and are well formed to convey the gist of the text.

AB  - We analyze a Big Data set of geo-tagged tweets for a year (Oct. 2013–Oct. 2014) to understand the regional linguistic variation in the U.S. Prior work on regional linguistic variations usually took a long time to collect data and focused on either rural or urban areas. Geo-tagged Twitter data offers an unprecedented database with rich linguistic representation of fine spatiotemporal resolution and continuity. From the one-year Twitter corpus, we extract lexical characteristics for twitter users by summarizing the frequencies of a set of lexical alternations that each user has used. We spatially aggregate and smooth each lexical characteristic to derive county-based linguistic variables, from which orthogonal dimensions are extracted using the principal component analysis (PCA). Finally a regionalization method is used to discover hierarchical dialect regions using the PCA components. The regionalization results reveal interesting linguistic regional variations in the U.S. The discovered regions not only confirm past research findings in the literature but also provide new insights and a more detailed understanding of very recent linguistic patterns in the U.S.

AB  - Characterizing human mobility patterns is essential for understanding human behaviors and the interactions with socioeconomic and natural environment, and plays a critical role in public health, urban planning, transportation engineering and related fields. With the widespread of location-aware mobile devices and continuing advancement of Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social media (LBSM) have been gaining widespread popularity in the past few years. With an access to locations of hundreds of million users, profiles and the contents of the social media posts, the LBSM data provided a novel modality of data source for human mobility study. By exploiting the explicit location footprints and mining the latent demographic information implied in the LBSM data, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of human mobility with a particular focus on the impact of demography. To serve this purpose, we first collect geo-tagged Twitter feeds posted in the conterminous United States area, and organize the collection of feeds using the concept of space-time trajectory corresponding to each Twitter user. Commonly human mobility measures, including detected home and activity centers, are derived for each user trajectory. We then select a subset of Twitter users that have detected home locations in the city of Chicago as a case study, and apply name analysis to the names provided in user profiles to learn the implicit demographic information of Twitter users, including race/ethnicity, gender and age. Finally we explore the spatiotemporal distribution and mobility characteristics of Chicago Twitter users, and investigate the demographic impact by comparing the differences across three demographic dimensions (race/ethnicity, gender and age). We found that, although the human mobility measures of different demographic groups generally follow the generic laws (e.g., power law distribution), the demographic information, particular the race/ethnicity group, significantly affects the urban human mobility patterns.

AB  - Business decision support tools, including social media data analysis, are required to help managers better understand trends and customer opinions. This paper presents a visual analytics-based approach to assist an expert user in tracking topics relative to his/her company from Twitter. Developed for visualizing topic long-term evolution and detecting weak signals, our process is composed of three complementary steps: (i) a time-dependent topic extraction based on a Latent Dirichlet Allocation, (ii) a topic relationship detection based on a dissimilarity which evaluates the topic proximities between consecutive time slots, and (iii) a topic evolution visualization inspired by a Sankey diagram popular in industrial environments to show dynamic relationships in a system. To test our approach, we have used a real-life dataset from the French energy company EDF from which we have analyzed the evolution of a corpus of more than 70000 tweets related to this company published over one year, and detected different types of evolving patterns hidden by the data volume and commonly masked by fully automatic mining algorithms.

AB  - The growing use of social media among Internet users produces a vast and new source of user generated ecological data, such as textual posts and images, which can be collected for research purposes. The increasing convergence between social and computer sciences has led researchers to develop automated methods to extract and analyze these digital footprints to predict personality traits. These social media-based predictions can then be used for a variety of purposes, including tailoring online services to improve user experience, enhance recommender systems, and as a possible screening and implementation tool for public health. In this paper, we conduct a series of meta-analyses to determine the predictive power of digital footprints collected from social media over Big 5 personality traits. Further, we investigate the impact of different types of digital footprints on prediction accuracy. Results of analyses show that the predictive power of digital footprints over personality traits is in line with the standard “correlational upper-limit” for behavior to predict personality, with correlations ranging from 0.29 (Agreeableness) to 0.40 (Extraversion). Overall, our findings indicate that accuracy of predictions is consistent across Big 5 traits, and that accuracy improves when analyses include demographics and multiple types of digital footprints.

AB  - Event and media services have recently witnessed a rapid growth driving the way people explore information of interest. A significant amount of social calendars, media memes and background knowledge are daily created on various platforms, conveying event clues or past users experience. Mining, in real-time, the connection of these distributed data fragments provides a key advantage not only to deliver enriched views, but also to gain insight into interesting sociological aspects. To this aim, we harness the power of Semantic Web technologies as means to easily steer the data integration and analysis. Our overall goal is to build a web-based environment that allows users to discover meaningful, surprising or entertaining connections between events, media and people. In this paper, we present EventMedia, a platform that provides descriptions of events associated with media, and interlinked with the Linked Data cloud. It draws on a live data update and a real-time interlinking to face the natural dynamics of events. A user-friendly interface has been designed to meet the user needs: relive experiences based on media and support decision making for attending upcoming events.

AB  - With the rapid growth of social media, users, especially adolescents, are spending significant amount of time on various social networking sites to connect with others, to share information, and to pursue common interests. However, as social networking has become widespread, certain people are finding illegal and unethical ways to use these communities as means for opening the door of inappropriate online activities. Thus, they are providing an open way for cybercrimes such as cyberbullying. In this paper, we deal with the aforementioned issue as a time series modelling methodology, aiming at the recognition of bullying patterns within the questions posed by a predator to his victims. Given a set of real world transcripts (i.e. the whole set of predator′s questions), in which each question is numerically labelled in terms of severity, we first model each set of predator′s questions as a time series. The next step is the main contribution of this paper, in terms of changing the representation scheme from time series data into symbolic representation. More specifically, inspired by the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) method, commonly used in computational biology for identifying conserved regions of similarity among raw molecular data, we represent the set of signals according to a SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) symbolic representation, transforming each signal into a symbol string. The main rationale behind this adoption lies to the fact that the collected cyberbullying data can be converted to string sequences via SAX conversion, which in turn can be aligned, thus revealing conserved temporal patterns or slight variations in the attacking strategies of the predators. Experimental results, based on the clustering improvement of the aforementioned data using the extracted patterns instead of the time series data, justify our claims.

AB  - Depression is a common chronic disorder. It often goes undetected due to limited diagnosis methods and brings serious results to public and personal health. Former research detected geographic pattern for depression using questionnaires or self-reported measures of mental health, this may induce same-source bias. Recent studies use social media for depression detection but none of them examines the geographic patterns. In this paper, we apply GIS methods to social media data to provide new perspectives for public health research. We design a procedure to automatically detect depressed users in Twitter and analyze their spatial patterns using GIS technology. This method can improve diagnosis techniques for depression. It is faster at collecting data and more promptly at analyzing and providing results. Also, this method can be expanded to detect other major events in real-time, such as disease outbreaks and earthquakes.

This paper presents contributions in several directions to improve the state-of-the-art in RGB-D scene labeling. First, we present a novel combination of depth and color features to recognize different object categories in isolation. Then, we use a context model that exploits detection results of other objects in the scene to jointly optimize labels of co-occurring objects in the scene. Finally, we investigate the use of social media mining to develop the context model, and provide an investigation of its convergence. We perform thorough experimentation on both the publicly available RGB-D Dataset from the University of Washington as well as on the NYU scene dataset. An analysis of the results shows interesting insights about contextual object category recognition, and its benefits.

(2014), we correlate the movements of both stock prices and social media content. This study differs from models in prior studies in two significant ways: (1) it leverages market information contained in high-volume social media data rather than news articles and (2) it does not evaluate sentiment. We test this model on data spanning from 2011 to 2015 on a majority of stocks listed in the S&P 500 Index and find that our model outperforms a baseline regression. We conclude by providing a trading strategy that produces an attractive annual return and Sharpe ratio.

Contextual factors can influence health through exposures to health-promoting and risk-inducing factors. The aim of this study was to (1) build, from geotagged Twitter and Yelp data, a national food environment database and (2) to test associations between state food environment indicators and health outcomes.
Study design
This is a cross-sectional study based upon secondary analyses of publicly available data.
Methods
Using Twitter's Streaming Application Programming Interface (API), we collected and processed 4,041,521 food-related, geotagged tweets between April 2015 and March 2016. Using Yelp's Search API, we collected data on 505,554 unique food-related businesses. In linear regression models, we examined associations between food environment characteristics and state-level health outcomes, controlling for state-level differences in age, percent non-Hispanic white, and median household income.
Results
A one standard deviation increase in caloric density of food tweets was related to higher all-cause mortality (+46.50 per 100,000), diabetes (+0.75%), obesity (+1.78%), high cholesterol (+1.40%), and fair/poor self-rated health (2.01%). More burger Yelp listings were related to higher prevalence of diabetes (+0.55%), obesity (1.35%), and fair/poor self-rated health (1.12%). More alcohol tweets and Yelp bars and pub listings were related to higher state-level binge drinking and heavy drinking, but lower mortality and lower percent reporting fair/poor self-rated health. Supplemental analyses with county-level social media indicators and county health outcomes resulted in finding similar but slightly attenuated associations compared to those found at the state level.
Conclusions
Social media can be utilized to create indicators of the food environment that are associated with area-level mortality, health behaviors, and chronic conditions.

AB  - The era of Web 2.0 is witnessing the proliferation of online social media platforms, which develop new business models by leveraging user-generated content. One rapidly growing source of user-generated data is online reviews, which play a very important role in disseminating information, facilitating trust, and promoting commerce in the e-marketplace. In this paper, we develop and compare several text regression models for predicting the helpfulness of online reviews. In addition to using review words as predictors, we examine the influence of reviewer engagement characteristics such as reputation, commitment, and current activity. We employ a reviewer's RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) dimensions to characterize his/her overall engagement and investigate if the inclusion of those dimensions helps improve the prediction of online review helpfulness. Empirical findings from text mining experiments conducted using reviews from Yelp and Amazon offer strong support to our thesis. We find that both review text and reviewer engagement characteristics help predict review helpfulness. The hybrid approach of combining the textual features of bag-of-words model and RFM dimensions produces the best prediction results. Furthermore, our approach facilitates the estimation of the helpfulness of new reviews instantly, making it possible for social media platforms to dynamically adjust the presentation of those reviews on their websites.

AB  - For more than three decades, the US has annually conducted Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys to capture health behavior and health status of its people. Though this kind of information at population level is important for local governments to identify local needs, traditional datasets take several years to collate and to become publicly available. Geocoded social media data can provide an alternative reflection of local health trends. Due to the large scale of data, such as approximately two billions of tweets in this work, aggregating the tweets at a population level is common practice. While alleviating the computational cost, the aggregation operation would result in the loss of information on the distribution of data over the population, and such information may be important for identifying the health behavior and health outcomes of the population. In this work, we propose statistical features constructed on-top of primary features to predict county-level health indices. The primary features include topics and linguistic patterns extracted from tweets with county-decoded information. In addition, tweeting behaviors, particularly tweeting time, are used as a predictor of the health indices. Apache Spark, an advanced cluster computing paradigm, was employed to efficiently process the large corpus of tweets, including geo-decoding the geotags, extracting low-level (primary) features, and computing the statistical features. The results show strong correlations between publicly available health indices and the features extracted from geospatially coded Twitter data. Statistical features gained higher correlation coefficients than did the aggregation ones, suggesting the potential and applicability of the proposed features in a wide spectrum of applications on data analytics at population levels. In addition, the prediction performance was also improved when the temporal information was employed. This demonstrates that the real-time analysis of social media data can provide timely insights into the health of populations.

AB  - Urban transport became an important element in the promotion of strategies towards sustainability, in fact one of the challenges posed by booming urban populations is the question of mobility. Traditional travel survey methods used to study urban mobility are very expensive, and the data collected are of poor quality. This is mainly explained because of the difficulty of getting a representative sample of the population, and the lack of motivated participants. Therefore, travel surveys are carried out less and less frequently, and the result is that good travel data is not available to develop mobility and travel behaviour studies. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) offer the opportunity to improve traditional travel survey methods, decreasing bias in the data, reducing respondent burden, and increasing data quality. On the other hand, nowadays the User Generated Content (UGC) is growing very fast in Internet. Social media have become a valuable source for knowledge but there is a big gap in the automatic Sentiment Analysis with Semantic taxonomy annotation of online textual content. The aim of this research is to identify sustainability issues related to urban mobility based in the perceptions and experiences that underlie in the UGC. The methodology follows a quantitative and qualitative content analysis using Sentiment Analysis techniques. This paper demonstrates empirically the feasibility of the automatic identification of the Sustainable Urban Mobility problems in the discourses generated by the UGC, through a powerful ad-hoc software combining Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis field tools. The main contribution of this work is the development of a tool and methodology on sustainability analysis on urban environment. Our approach enriches the data of the traditional surveys, extends traditional analysis with Big-Data methods, using data mining algorithms and Natural Language Processing techniques to extract urban mobility information from Social Media data. These data include important information about activities and travels, and can help to improve our understanding of urban mobility.

AB  - Public perceptions of climate change are traditionally measured through surveys. The exploding popularity of social networks, however, presents a new opportunity to research the spatiotemporal pattern of public discourse in relation to natural and/or socio-economic events. Among the social networks, Twitter is one of the largest microblogging services. The architecture of Twitter makes the question “what's happening?” the cornerstone of information exchange. This inspired the notion of using Twitter users as distributed sensors, which has been successfully employed in both the natural and social sciences. In 2012 and 2013, we collected 1.8 million tweets on “climate change” and “global warming” in five major languages (English, German, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish). We discuss the geography of tweeting, weekly and daily patterns, major news events that affected tweeting on climate change, changes in the central topics of discussion over time, the most authoritative traditional media, blogging, and the most authoritative organizational sources of information on climate change referenced by Twitter users in different countries. We anticipate that social network mining will become a major source of data in the public discourse on climate change.

AB  - In this study, we design, develop, implement and test an analytical framework and measurement model to detect scientific discoveries with ‘breakthrough’ characteristics. To do so, we have developed a series of computerised search algorithms that data mine large quantities of research publications. These algorithms facilitate early-stage detection of ‘breakout’ papers that emerge as highly cited and distinctive and are considered to be potential breakthroughs. Combining computer-aided data mining with decision heuristics, enabled us to assess structural changes within citation patterns with the international scientific literature. In our case studies, we applied a citation impact time window of 24–36 months after publication of each research paper. In this paper, we report on our test results, in which five algorithms were applied to the entire Web of Science database. We analysed the citation impact patterns of all research articles from the period 1990–1994. We succeeded in detecting many papers with distinctive impact profiles (breakouts). A small subset of these breakouts is classified as ‘breakthroughs': Nobel Prize research papers; papers occurring in Nature's Top-100 Most Cited Papers Ever; papers still (highly) cited by review papers or patents; or those frequently mentioned in today's social media. We also compare the outcomes of our algorithms with the results of a ‘baseline’ detection algorithm developed by Redner in 2005, which selects the world's most highly cited ‘hot papers'. The detection rates of the algorithms vary, but overall, they present a powerful tool for tracing breakout papers in science. The wider applicability of these algorithms, across all science fields, has not yet been ascertained. Whether or not our early-stage breakout papers present a ‘breakthrough’ remains a matter of opinion, where input from subject experts is needed for verification and confirmation, but our detection approach certain helps to limit the search domain to trace and track important emerging topics in science.

While successful for low-level activities (e.g. walking or standing), high-level activities (e.g. watching movies or attending lectures) are difficult to distinguish from motion data alone. Furthermore, instrumentation of complex body sensor network at population scale is impractical. In this work, we take an alternative approach of leveraging rich, dynamic, and crowd-generated self-report data from social media platforms as the basis for in-situ activity recognition. By treating the user as the “sensor”, we make use of implicit signals emitted from natural use of mobile smartphones, in the form of textual content, semantic location, and time. Tackling both the task of recognizing a main activity (multi-class classification) and recognizing all applicable activity categories (multi-label tagging) from one instance, we are able to obtain mean accuracies of more than 75%. We conduct a thorough analysis and interpret of our model to illustrate a promising first step towards comprehensive, high-level activity recognition using instrumentation-free, crowdsourced, social media data.

AB  - Vaccines have contributed to dramatically decrease mortality from infectious diseases in the 20th century. However, several social discussion groups related to vaccines have emerged, influencing the opinion of the population about vaccination for the past 20 years. These communities discussing on vaccines have taken advantage of social media to effectively disseminate their theories. Nowadays, recent outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles, polio, or influenza, have shown the effect of a decrease in vaccination rates. Social Networks are one of the most important sources of Big Data. Specifically, Twitter generates over 400 million tweets every day. Data mining provides the necessary algorithms and techniques to analyse massive data and to discover new knowledge. This work proposes the use of these techniques to detect and track discussion communities on vaccination arising from Social Networks. Firstly, a preliminary analysis using data from Twitter and official vaccination coverage rates is performed, showing how vaccine opinions of Twitter users can influence over vaccination decision-making. Then, algorithms for community detection are applied to discover user groups opining about vaccines. The experimental results show that these techniques can be used to discover social discussion communities providing useful information to improve immunization strategies. Public Healthcare Organizations may try to use the detection and tracking of these social communities to avoid or mitigate new outbreaks of eradicated diseases.

AB  - Clustering plays a major role in data mining. It helps in identifying patterns and distribution of data. In this paper, we propose ant colony optimization (ACO) based clustering algorithm for clustering the social network data. The proposed technique takes advantage of Ants cemetery and allows each ant to play a role. In every iteration, the ants produce a cluster for the data, and the pheromone values are updated after every iteration of all the ants. The experiment results show that proposed technique discovered the clusters which reveal the truthfulness of the network. We have also compared the proposed technique with another state of the art clustering algorithm, and experimental result demonstrated that proposed technique find out the better clusters.

AB  - Road traffic congestion is an important issue in modern cities, however most existing traffic jam identification solutions are based on expensive facilities such as sensors or transport probe infrastructure with high deployment and management costs. As a result of the cost, such solutions are not ubiquitously deployed. The extensive use of smart mobile devices furnished with location-based competencies and the global popularity of microblogging applications like Twitter offers an opportunity to tackle these problems. Twitter users can serve as human traffic sensors providing real-time reflections of current traffic situations. However, these data can contain extensive personal privacy information that demands privacy preserving mechanisms for the user location and their current trajectory. Differential privacy can ensure that degrees of privacy in these trajectories can be preserved whilst allowing data analysis and mining of the Twitter content. This paper proposes an innovative private trajectories release model and associated algorithms with differential privacy guarantees that considers both data privacy and data utility. This includes development of a private reference system for calibrating separate (raw) users trajectories across obfuscated anchor points; construction of privacy supporting noise-enhanced prefix trees to release synthesis data privately, and comprehensive evaluation of both the accuracy and utility of the solutions in terms of a set of evaluation metrics based on real-life tweets-based user trajectories across the city of Melbourne.

AB  - Due to the increasing popularity of contents of social media platforms, the number of posts and messages is steadily increasing. A huge amount of data is generated daily as an outcome of the interactions between fans of the networking platforms. It becomes extremely troublesome to find the most relevant, interactive information for the subscribers. The aim of this work is to enable the users to get a powerful brief of comments without reading the entire list. This paper opens up a new field of short text summarization (STS) predicated on a hybrid ant colony optimization coming with a mechanism of local search, called ACO-LS-STS, to produce an optimal or near-optimal summary. Initially, the graph coloring algorithm, called GC-ISTS, was employed before to shrink the solution area of ants to small sets. Evidently, the main purpose of using the GC algorithm is to make the search process more facilitated, faster and prevents the ants from falling into the local optimum. First, the dissimilar comments are assembled together into the same color, at the same time preserving the information ratio as for an original list of comment. Subsequently, activating the ACO-LS-STS algorithm, which is a novel technique concerning the extraction of the most interactive comments from each color in a parallel form. At the end, the best summary is picked from the best color. This problem is formalized as an optimization problem utilizing GC and ACO-LS to generate the optimal solution. Eventually, the proposed algorithm was evaluated and tested over a collection of Facebook messages with their associated comments. Indeed, it was found that the proposed algorithm has an ability to capture a good solution that is guaranteed to be near optimal and had realized notable performance in comparison with traditional document summarization algorithms.

AB  - As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, the need for fresh fruits and vegetables in urban areas grows while the difficulty of bringing these perishable products to these areas also increases. Small-scale agriculture located in urban areas is a highly effective and profitable way to provide these products to communities that are far from extensive commercial agricultural areas. Here we describe how remote sensing can be used with data mining approaches to monitor urban and peri-urban farms within cities in both developed and developing countries. Using very high resolution satellite imagery together with moderate and coarse resolution imagery and information from social media and the web, we analyze the usefulness of different methods to identify farms within urban boundaries in four countries. The analysis shows how a mixed-method approach is necessary in order to identify where urban farming is occurring and to monitor its change through time. Although remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices were useful, without ancillary data they are not effective at remotely mapping the locations of urban farms. However, remote sensing is a good way to monitor vegetation condition in locations where actively managed urban farms are known to exist.

AB  - The way people express their opinions has radically changed in the past few years thanks to the advent of online collaborative media. The distillation of knowledge from this huge amount of unstructured information can be a key factor for marketers who want to create an identity for their product or brand in the minds of their customers. These online social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are specifically meant for human consumption. Existing approaches to opinion mining, in fact, are still far from being able to infer the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language as they mainly rely on knowledge bases that are too limited to efficiently process text at concept-level. In this context, standard clustering techniques have been previously employed on an affective common-sense knowledge base in attempt to discover how different natural language concepts are semantically and affectively related to each other and, hence, to accordingly mine on-line opinions. In this work, a novel cognitive model based on the combined use of multi-dimensional scaling and artificial neural networks is exploited for better modelling the way multi-word expressions are organised in a brain-like universe of natural language concepts. The integration of a biologically inspired paradigm with standard principal component analysis helps to better grasp the non-linearities of the resulting vector space and, hence, improve the affective common-sense reasoning capabilities of the system.

AB  - A huge number of videos are posted every day on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. This makes the Internet an unlimited source of information. In the coming decades, coping with such information and mining useful knowledge from it will be an increasingly difficult task. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for multimodal sentiment analysis, which consists in harvesting sentiments from Web videos by demonstrating a model that uses audio, visual and textual modalities as sources of information. We used both feature- and decision-level fusion methods to merge affective information extracted from multiple modalities. A thorough comparison with existing works in this area is carried out throughout the paper, which demonstrates the novelty of our approach. Preliminary comparative experiments with the YouTube dataset show that the proposed multimodal system achieves an accuracy of nearly 80%, outperforming all state-of-the-art systems by more than 20%.

AB  - In today's competitive business environment, there is a strong need for businesses to collect, monitor, and analyze user-generated data on their own and on their competitors’ social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. To achieve a competitive advantage, it is often necessary to listen to and understand what customers are saying about competitors’ products and services. Current social media analytics frameworks do not provide benchmarks that allow businesses to compare customer sentiment on social media to easily understand where businesses are doing well and where they need to improve. In this paper, we present a social media competitive analytics framework with sentiment benchmarks that can be used to glean industry-specific marketing intelligence. Based on the idea of the proposed framework, new social media competitive analytics with sentiment benchmarks can be developed to enhance marketing intelligence and to identify specific actionable areas in which businesses are leading and lagging to further improve their customers’ experience using customer opinions gleaned from social media. Guided by the proposed framework, an innovative business-driven social media competitive analytics tool named VOZIQ is developed. We use VOZIQ to analyze tweets associated with five large retail sector companies and to generate meaningful business insight reports.

AB  - In the context of social media, the unstructured and dynamic nature of exchanged data and the information overload contribute to the growth of the number of research works proposing methods to improve performance of intelligent analytics services considering both time and semantics of the shared content. The presented paper focuses on the definition of a knowledge tracking framework to answer questions, such as “What is the semantic evolution of a topic (or news) along the time?”, “How did we arrive to a specific event?”, “What is the evolution of the topics of interest of a user?”, and so on. Our interest is about the elicitation of temporal patterns revealing the evolution of concepts along the time from a social media data stream; we focus on Twitter. Such patterns can be extracted at different levels of abstraction by considering different-sized time intervals and different scopes driven by the conceptualization of users’ queries. To address the proposed aim, we extend Temporal Concept Analysis and we use Description Logic to reason on semantically represented tweet streams. The evaluation activity reveals promising results from both sides quantitative and qualitative.

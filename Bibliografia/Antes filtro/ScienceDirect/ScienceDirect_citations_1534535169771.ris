AB  - This study combined two bibliometric analysis methods to provide a systematic and holistic review of social media-related academic literature. A total of 406 publications related to social media between 2007 and 2016 were identified from 16 business and hospitality/tourism journals. Co-citation analysis identified Word-of-Mouth as the major theoretical foundation of social media research in business, while the hospitality/tourism field presented a diverse theoretical foundation. The study then employed co-word analysis to identify the evolution of research themes over time in both fields. The comparison of social media research between the two fields highlighted four similarities, including the growth of research over time, the term “social media” gaining popularity, the new trend of social networking sites, and managerial applications as research focus. Finally, the study called for a future research agenda on social media research in the hospitality/tourism field.

AB  - With the popularity of social network, social media data embedding has attracted extensive research interest and boomed many applications, such as image classification and cross-modal retrieval. In this paper, we examine the scenario of social images containing multimodal content (e.g., visual content and textual tags) and connecting with each other (e.g., two images submitted to the same group). In such a case, both the multimodal content and link information provide useful clues for representation learning. Therefore, simply learning the embedding from network structure or data content results in sub-optimal social image representation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Multimodal Attention Networks (DMAN) to combine multimodal content and link information for social image embedding. Specifically, to effectively incorporate the multimodal content, a visual-textual attention model is proposed to encode the fine-granularity correlation between multimodal content, i.e., the alignment between image regions and textual words. To incorporate the network structure for embedding learning, a novel Siamese-Triplet neural network is proposed to model the first-order proximity and the second-order proximity among images. Then the two modules are integrated into a joint deep model for social image embedding. Once the representation has been learned, a wide variety of data mining problems can be solved by using the task-specific algorithms designed for handling vector representations. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multi-label classification and cross-modal search.

AB  - Technology had been used in health domain for various purposes such as for storing electronic health records; monitoring; education; communication; and for behavioural tracking. The evident benefits have triggered a huge amount of discussions surrounding health technology in the web 3.0 space and users around the globe are sharing their experiences and perspective on social media platforms. Social media had been used for creating awareness, sharing information and providing emotional support to public in different diseases. This study focuses on exploring the health technology related discussions in Twitter. For this study around 105,489 tweets were collected from Twitter by 15,587 unique users. These tweets were analysed through social media analytics approaches (i.e. CUP framework). The study presents the top technologies in health domain through hashtag analysis and top diseases (acute, chronic, communicable and non-communicable) through word analysis and their association through co-occurrence of words within the tweets. The association depicts technology had been used in treating, identifying and heeling of the various diseases. The discussion on social media is skewed towards computing algorithms. The acute and chronic diseases were discussed on social media, and our study indicates that statistically, there is no difference in the discussion of acute and chronic diseases. The communicable and non-communicable diseases are also discussed on social media, and our study indicates no statistically difference in the discussion of communicable and non-communicable diseases which signifies users are referring to Twitter for discussing various type of diseases irrespective of acute, chronic, communicable and non-communicable diseases. Future researchers can use the study as the evidence of extracting insights related to socio-technical perspective from Twitter data. The literature contains lot of evidences where technology had been useful in health domain, but the bigger picture of how the various technologies are being related to health domain is missing, therefore this study tries to contribute to this area by mining tweets.

AB  - Australia's national economy continues to benefit from the extraction and exportation of non-renewable resources, even despite the end of its mining boom. The negative impacts of this primary industry endure and are felt disproportionately by rural communities in close proximity to mining sites. The challenge of holding mining and extractive companies to account for social concerns – which may be difficult to measure or pin down to any one cause – has influenced affected communities to look to other, non-regulatory means of accountability to raise their concerns and see them addressed. ‘Social licence to operate’ (SLO) is often touted as one such tool for holding large resource companies to account. But a growing field of research into the concept has remained largely focused on social capital measures and has yet to consider the conditions necessary to facilitate communities’ successful deployment of SLO as an accountability mechanism or negotiation tool. There remains a gap in our understanding about how SLO can be used meaningfully by communities as a tool for advocacy and accountability, especially in company-community negotiations. This article introduces a strategic action fields (SAFs) approach to SLO to facilitate exploration of the relative strength between and within differing views (power), requirements and agendas of stakeholder groups (strategic agendas) and the aligned interconnections of affected stakeholders (social cohesion), thus enhancing understandings of SLO possible through a social capital approach. In introducing SAFs for SLO, this article extends research on SLO measurement through exploration of three central research questions. First, it asks whether and how SLO might exist as more than a benchmark measurement of acceptability, as defined primarily from corporate, risk-based perspectives? Secondly, building on existing, social capital-based approaches to SLO measurement, are there other approaches that could complement or extend a social capital approach to SLO to understand better a community's ability to operationalise it? Following this, how might insights possible via a complementary means of SLO measurement assist us to expand current understandings about the role of relationships in granting SLO? Three M&E sector case studies from the resource intensive states of Western Australia and Queensland are explored via a set of 105 government, public, media, social media and other related documents. Data was thematically analysed using N*Vivo10 software. Application of social capital and SAFs approaches reveals key tensions in claims to a SLO, especially where, under a social capital-only approach, strong relationships between particular stakeholders would suggest that a SLO has been granted. The addition of a SAFs lens—especially consideration of social cohesion—reveals that even where SLO may be granted, it may not necessarily be operationalizable by communities due to these competing fields. The article concludes with suggestions about the benefits of applying SAFs to SLO measurement, as a means of teasing out the utility of the concept to affected stakeholders. Recommendations for future research adopting this approach are also suggested.

AB  - Credit rating is a process for building a classification system for credit lenders to characterize current or potential credit borrowers. By such a process, financial institutions classify borrowers for lending decision by evaluating their financial and/or nonfinancial performances. Recently, use of social media data has emerged an important source of information. Accordingly, social media data can be very useful in evaluating companies' credibility when financial or non-financial assessments are missing or unreliable as well as when credit analyzers' subjective perceptions manipulate the decision. In this study, a multiple criteria credit rating approach is proposed to determine companies' credibility level utilizing social media data as well as financial measures. Additionally, to strengthen the lender's interpretation and inference competency, ratings are represented with a risk distribution based on cumulative belief degrees. Sentiment analysis, a web mining and text classification method, is used to collect social media data on Twitter. Importance of criteria is revealed through pairwise comparisons. Companies' performance scores and ratings are obtained by a cumulative belief degree approach. The proposed approach is applied to 64 companies. Results indicate that social media provides valuable information to determine companies' creditability. However credit ratings tend to decrease when social media data is considered.

AB  - Online news has become one of the major channels for Internet users to get news. News websites are daily overwhelmed with plenty of news articles. Huge amounts of online news articles are generated and updated everyday, and the processing and analysis of this large corpus of data is an important challenge. This challenge needs to be tackled by using big data techniques which process large volume of data within limited run times. Also, since we are heading into a social-media data explosion, techniques such as text mining or social network analysis need to be seriously taken into consideration. In this work we focus on one of the most common daily activities: web news reading. News websites produce thousands of articles covering a wide spectrum of topics or categories which can be considered as a big data problem. In order to extract useful information, these news articles need to be processed by using big data techniques. In this context, we present an approach for classifying huge amounts of different news articles into various categories (topic areas) based on the text content of the articles. Since these categories are constantly updated with new articles, our approach is based on Evolving Fuzzy Systems (EFS). The EFS can update in real time the model that describes a category according to the changes in the content of the corresponding articles. The novelty of the proposed system relies in the treatment of the web news articles to be used by these systems and the implementation and adjustment of them for this task. Our proposal not only classifies news articles, but it also creates human interpretable models of the different categories. This approach has been successfully tested using real on-line news.

AB  - Given 70% of Americans are seeking health information online, social media are becoming main sources of health-related information and discussions. Specifically, compounding rising trends in use of e-cigarettes in the US, there has been a rapid rise in e-cigarette marketing – much of which is happening on social media. Public health professionals seeking to understand consumer knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about e-cigarettes should consider analyzing social media data and to do so, there are numerous free and paid tools available. However, each uses different sources and processes, which makes data validation challenging. This exploratory study sought to understand the reliability and feasibility of two social media data tools analyzing e-cigarette tweets. Twitter mentions were pulled from two different industry standard tools (GNIP and Radian6) and data were evaluated on six measures, e.g. Cost, Feasibility, Ease of Use, Poster Type (individual/organization), Context (tweet content analysis), and Valence (positive/negative). Findings included similarities amongst the data sets in terms of the content themes but differences in cost and ease of use of the tools themselves. These findings align with prior research, notably that e-cigarette marketing tweets are most common and public health-related content is noticeably absent. Findings from this exploratory study can inform future social media studies as well as communication campaigns seeking to address the emerging issue of e-cigarette use.

AB  - Educators show great interest in participating in social-media communities, such as Twitter, to support their professional development and learning. The majority of the research into Twitter-based professional learning communities has investigated why educators choose to use Twitter for professional development and learning and what they actually do in these communities. However, few studies have examined why certain community members remain committed and others gradually drop out. To fill this gap in the research, this study investigated how some key features of online discourse influenced the continued participation of the members of a Twitter-based professional learning community. More than 600,000 tweets generated over six years under the hashtag #edchat were gathered. Online discourse was deconstructed to the cognitive dimension, the interactive dimension, and the social dimension. Text-mining methods were then used to automatically identify these dimensions in the tweets. Finally, survival analysis was used to quantify the influences of these dimensions on users' commitment time to the Twitter community. The implications of the results and findings are then discussed.

AB  - Introduction
The authors of this work propose an unsupervised machine learning model that has the ability to identify real-world latent infectious diseases by mining social media data. In this study, a latent infectious disease is defined as a communicable disease that has not yet been formalized by national public health institutes and explicitly communicated to the general public. Most existing approaches to modeling infectious-disease-related knowledge discovery through social media networks are top-down approaches that are based on already known information, such as the names of diseases and their symptoms. In existing top-down approaches, necessary but unknown information, such as disease names and symptoms, is mostly unidentified in social media data until national public health institutes have formalized that disease. Most of the formalizing processes for latent infectious diseases are time consuming. Therefore, this study presents a bottom-up approach for latent infectious disease discovery in a given location without prior information, such as disease names and related symptoms.
Methods
Social media messages with user and temporal information are extracted during the data preprocessing stage. An unsupervised sentiment analysis model is then presented. Users’ expressions about symptoms, body parts, and pain locations are also identified from social media data. Then, symptom weighting vectors for each individual and time period are created, based on their sentiment and social media expressions. Finally, latent-infectious-disease-related information is retrieved from individuals’ symptom weighting vectors.
Datasets and results
Twitter data from August 2012 to May 2013 are used to validate this study. Real electronic medical records for 104 individuals, who were diagnosed with influenza in the same period, are used to serve as ground truth validation. The results are promising, with the highest precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.773, 0.680, and 0.724, respectively.
Conclusion
This work uses individuals’ social media messages to identify latent infectious diseases, without prior information, quicker than when the disease(s) is formalized by national public health institutes. In particular, the unsupervised machine learning model using user, textual, and temporal information in social media data, along with sentiment analysis, identifies latent infectious diseases in a given location.

AB  - In today’s world, social networks and online communities continuously generate tons of data that reflect users’ habits, personal interests, opinions and emotions. However, little profit can be gained from such huge raw data collections unless we are able to translate them into useful knowledge. Microblogs like Twitter have recently attracted a great body of research works to mine useful insights about users interests and preferences in different geographical areas and time periods. Indeed, the rather heterogeneous dimensions characterizing Twitter data, such as space, time and text content, impose innovative methods in the data mining discovery process. This paper presents TCharM, a data analytics methodology based on cluster analysis and association rule discovery to gain interesting knowledge from large collections of Twitter data. TCharM explores tweet collections along the three dimensions characterizing tweets (i.e., text content, posting time and place) to support context-aware topic trend analysis. To discover groups of tweets with a good cohesion on the three tweet features, TCharM exploits a novel distance measure (TASTE) which allows driving the clustering task by considering in one step the three tweet features. Association rule analysis is then exploited to concisely describe the cluster content with a set of understandable and significant patterns which reveal underlying correlations among frequent topics, tweeting times and places. TCharM can provide useful information to understand the evolution of people’s involvement in different topics, across geographical areas and over time. TCharM find applications in various domains by providing a valuable support in decision making to domain experts. The experimental evaluation performed on real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in discovering cohesive clusters and actionable knowledge from Twitter data.

AB  - Big data has dramatically changed the study of political communications online as researchers access massive feeds of data on social media behavior, networks, and language. However, the nature political communication remains inherently message-driven, where the composition, timing, and metaphor are necessary components of the overall message. This article surveys research on political communication on Twitter and classifies it into seven subjective domains of research. The methodological approaches that have been applied toward these domains include quantitative technique studying the size, shape, profile of the networks and their nodes; large-scale data mining techniques applied to study the contents of Twitter messaging; and qualitative methods for in-depth study of messages. Showing that qualitative research methods have extended our understanding of political communications domains, we propose that small data approaches, through interpretive analysis and commentary by human readers, can be coupled with large-scale data analysis for deeper, contextual understanding of political messaging.

AB  - Online social media is able to convey rich and timely information about real-world events. Uncovering events on social media and sensing topics from them can acquire much valuable information, which has attracted significant research effort. However, due to the large scale of data, to detect events or topics in real time is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Pattern-based Topic Detection and Analysis System (PTDAS) on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform in China. As one of the key components of the whole system, a FP-growth-like algorithm is employed to mine cosine interesting patterns from a set of tweets, and then summarize them as topics. Specially, in order to discover topics in real-time, we parallelize the algorithm on Spark for efficient mining. Along with pattern-based topic detection, we also present some analytic techniques, including both topic evolving analysis and sentimental analysis. Extensive experiments on the real-world data set demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PTDAS.

AB  - With the rapid growth of social media, text mining is extensively utilized in practical fields, and opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, plays an important role in analyzing opinion and sentiment in texts. Methods in opinion mining generally depend on a sentiment lexicon, which is a set of predefined key words that express sentiment. Opinion mining requires proper sentiment words to be extracted in advance and has difficulty classifying sentences that imply an opinion without using any sentiment key words. This paper presents a new sentiment analysis method, based on text-based hidden Markov models (TextHMMs), for text classification that uses a sequence of words in training texts instead of a predefined sentiment lexicon. We sought to learn text patterns representing sentiment through ensemble TextHMMs. Our method defines hidden variables in TextHMMs by semantic cluster information in consideration of the co-occurrence of words, and thus calculates the sentiment orientation of sentences by fitted TextHMMs. To reflect diverse patterns, we applied an ensemble of TextHMM-based classifiers. In the experiments with a benchmark data set, we show that this method is superior to some existing methods and particularly has potential to classify implicit opinions. We also demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method in a real-life data set of online market reviews.

AB  - Being a widely adapted and acknowledged practice for the representation of inter- and intra-dependent information streams, network graphs are nowadays growing vast in both size and complexity, due to the rapid expansion of sources, types, and amounts of produced data. In this context, the efficient processing of the big amounts of information, also known as Big Data forms a major challenge for both the research community and a wide variety of industrial sectors, involving security, health and financial applications. Serving these emerging needs, the current paper presents a Graph Analytics based Platform (GAP) that implements a top-down approach for the facilitation of Data Mining processes through the incorporation of state-of-the-art techniques, like behavioural clustering, interactive visualizations, multi-objective optimization, etc. The applicability of this platform is validated on 2 istinct real-world use cases, which can be considered as characteristic examples of modern Big Data problems, due to the vast amount of information they deal with. In particular, (i) the root cause analysis of a Denial of Service attack in the network of a mobile operator and (ii) the early detection of an emerging event or a hot topic in social media communities. In order to address the large volume of the data, the proposed application starts with an aggregated overview of the whole network and allows the operator to gradually focus on smaller sets of data, using different levels of abstraction. The proposed platform offers differentiation between different user behaviors that enable the analyst to obtain insight on the network’s operation and to extract the meaningful information in an effortless manner. Dynamic hypothesis formulation techniques exploited by graph traversing and pattern mining, enable the analyst to set concrete network-related hypotheses, and validate or reject them accordingly.

AB  - Characterizing and mining people’s individual mobility pattern (IMP) has recently attracted much attention, and has shown great potential significance in many application fields, e.g., transportation planning, activity prediction, supermarket location decision, resource allocation in distributed and communication systems, etc. Social media has been widely regarded as an effective data source for IMP mining as it contains huge records with location and temporal tags. Existing social media based IMP mining methods mainly focus on the spatial aspect (e.g., points-of-interests). Some recent studies argue that, besides spatial aspect, IMP also exhibits temporal feature, and therefore it is more significant to find out the spatial–temporal path (STP). However, we notice that existing studies can only generate single STP for each individual. In practice, there may exist multiple STPs for an individual over a long time period. Regarding such fact, in this paper, we argue that it is more rationale to find out multiple STPs (mSTP) for each individual. While, this is a non-trivial task due to the inherent sparsity and uncertainty in social media based location data. To address this problem, we propose a social media based mSTP mining framework. The spatial–temporal hotspots of individual activities are first clustered. Bayesian theorem is then applied to find out the mSTP amongst the generated hotspots. An mSTP visualization method is also provided to further indicate the relationship amongst the mined mSTP. Experiments with collected trace from Weibo, the biggest social media in China, is conducted to evaluate the validity of the proposed method with respect to several metrics. The experiment results indicate that the our method is able to correctly mine mSTPs consistent with human common sense.

AB  - Social media and online services with user-generated content (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube) have made a staggering amount of information (and misinformation) available. Government officials seek to leverage these resources to improve services and communication with citizens. Significant potential exists to identify issues in real time, so emergency managers can monitor and respond to issues concerning public safety. Yet, the sheer volume of social data streams generates substantial noise that must be filtered in order to detect meaningful patterns and trends. Important events can then be identified as spikes in activity, while event meaning and consequences can be deciphered by tracking changes in content and public sentiment. This paper presents findings from a exploratory study we conducted between June and December 2010 with government officials in Arlington, VA (and the greater National Capitol Region around Washington, D.C.), with the broad goal of understanding social media use by government officials as well as community organizations, businesses, and the public at large. A key objective was also to understand social media use specifically for managing crisis situations from the routine (e.g., traffic, weather crises) to the critical (e.g., earthquakes, floods).

AB  - Adequate global sourcing makes a strategic difference to an organization's ability to reduce cost and improve the quality of its product. However, the global sourcing makes the process of supplier selection riskier and more complex. The data required for confronting the criteria needs to be specific and up-to-date. Now that we have entered the Big Data era with the prominence of social media and social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn; we now have access to global insights and knowledge regarding international suppliers. In this research, we propose a Twitter Enabled Supplier Status Assessment (TESSA) tool that can assist companies in their global supplier selection process. TESSA firstly retrieves a target supplier's related information from the most popular microblog Twitter and then obtains potential risk and uncertainty regarding the supplier through text mining. The discovered risks and uncertainties for companies making better decision on their global supplier selection process.

AB  - Business Intelligence that applies data analytics to generate key information to support business decision making, has been an important area for more than two decades. In the last five years, the trend of “Big Data” has emerged and become a core element of Business Intelligence research. In this article, we review academic literature associated with “Big Data” and “Business Intelligence” to explore the development and research trends. We use bibliometric methods to analyze publications from 1990 to 2017 in journals indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). We map the time trend, disciplinary distribution, high-frequency keywords to show emerging topics. The findings indicate that Computer Science and management information systems are two core disciplines that drive research associated with Big Data and Business Intelligence. “Data mining”, “social media” and “information system” are high frequency keywords, but “cloud computing”, “data warehouse” and “knowledge management” are more emphasized after 2016.

AB  - The growing number of people using social media to communicate with others and document their personal opinion and action is creating a significant stream of data that provides the opportunity for social scientists to conduct online forms of research, providing an insight into online social formations. This paper investigates the possibility of forecasting spikes in social tension – defined by the UK police service as “any incident that would tend to show that the normal relationship between individuals or groups has seriously deteriorated” – through social media. A number of different computational methods were trialed to detect spikes in tension using a human coded sample of data collected from Twitter, relating to an accusation of racial abuse during a Premier League football match. Conversation analysis combined with syntactic and lexicon-based text mining rules; sentiment analysis; and machine learning methods was tested as a possible approach. Results indicate that a combination of conversation analysis methods and text mining outperforms a number of machine learning approaches and a sentiment analysis tool at classifying tension levels in individual tweets.

AB  - The popularity of many social media sites has prompted both academic and practical research on the possibility of mining social media data for the analysis of public sentiment. Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Twitter could be well correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, it remains unclear how public sentiment, as reflected on social media, can be used to predict stock price movement of a particular publicly-listed company. In this study, we attempt to fill this research void by proposing a technique, called SMeDA-SA, to mine Twitter data for sentiment analysis and then predict the stock movement of specific listed companies. For the purpose of experimentation, we collected 200 million tweets that mentioned one or more of 30 companies that were listed in NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. SMeDA-SA performs its task by first extracting ambiguous textual messages from these tweets to create a list of words that reflects public sentiment. SMeDA-SA then made use of a data mining algorithm to expand the word list by adding emotional phrases so as to better classify sentiments in the tweets. With SMeDA-SA, we discover that the stock movement of many companies can be predicted rather accurately with an average accuracy over 70%. This paper describes how SMeDA-SA can be used to mine social media date for sentiments. It also presents the key implications of our study.

AB  - Resilience is a broad concept that encompasses different kinds of phenomena, such as effective functioning under severe conditions, adaptation to stress and attaining normal functioning after exposure to potentially traumatic experiences. The study of resilient behavior of individuals, communities and societies provide researchers and practitioners with better knowledge and understanding of human coping and adaptation. Reports about unfortunate and stressful events in social media news sites trigger various appraisals among social media users. Some of these appraisals are translated into user generated symbolic, textual and visual content - and offer a unique opportunity to observe how the public “digests” and copes with the changing reality. With the rise of social media, the abundance of user-generated content, public application programming interfaces for social media services and the availability of efficient data extraction and analytical tools – researchers and practitioners can explore in detail citizen' attitudes towards various issues in their external environment, including in-depth understanding of their coping modes and resiliency. The objective of this review is to describe how existing and recently developed tools in the field of social computing can be utilized to assess different aspects of resilience, through mining of the social media. We propose several indicators for resilience factors, and present methods and techniques to search, processes and analyze textual and visual content, commonly published on social media. It is proposed that automatic and immediate detection of resilience factors in users’ discourse, will significantly improve the ability of decision makers generate public situational awareness based on social media data.

AB  - Background
We seek to evaluate factors that could potentially impact the public's attitudes to PTSD related marijuana use on Twitter.
Methods
We collected tweets that contained the “PTSD” and “Post Trauma Stress Disorder” from August 1, 2015 to April 15, 2016 (n = 1,253,872 tweets). A Naïve Bayes model was constructed to classify tweets into two opinion polarities (support vs. neutral/against marijuana use for PTSD).
Results
The marijuana related tweets were predominated by the supporting opinions (89.6%). The public opinions about marijuana use for PTSD on Twitter were significantly associated with state-level legislation. States that legalized medical and recreational marijuana use had the highest prevalence of support tweets (1.3 ± 0.6), followed by the states that legalized medical but not recreational use (0.5 ± 0.3) and the states that had no laws legalizing marijuana (0.2 ± 0.1, p < 0.0001). A higher prevalence of support tweets was associated with states with a lower proportion of youth (r = −0.35, p = 0.01) and a higher education rate (r = 0.38, p = 0.006).
Conclusion
Twitter data suggest a proliferation of supporting marijuana use for PTSD treatments, especially in the states that legalized medical and/or recreational use of marijuana.

AB  - Capturing public perceptions regarding transit systems is an essential part of creating a just and equitable service. Gathering such perceptions also holds the potential for identifying ways of increasing ridership and for identifying sources of transport-related social exclusion. Traditionally, these perceptions have been obtained from public participatory forums or via surveys on users’ opinions. However, increasingly, the use of alternative methods of obtaining public perceptions has included media and social media sources. Twitter is one such social media source and it is used in this research to obtain public opinions regarding a bus rapid transit system (BRT). Rather than relying upon purely automated data mining techniques for analyzing Twitter feeds, a traditional qualitative research design is used featuring a two-step process. First, a text mining procedure is used on the Twitter feeds filtered out by keywords relevant to the transit system, and secondly, a structured content analysis is applied to the entries. This method is applied to a case study on a Bus Rapid Transit system in Cali, Colombia. The results highlight concerns with safety, problems with the system’s infrastructure, and behavioral issues on the bus as primary points of discussion.

However, there is a bottleneck that the amount of available viewing logs and user friendship networks are too limited to design effective recommendation algorithms. Thus, carrying out an intelligent program recommendation system is important for these sites. In this work, we propose a novel model which turns to the social networks and mine user preferences information expressed in microblogs for evaluating the similarity between online movies and TV episodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first effort to bridge the gap between movie and TV watchers domain with social network activities. Moreover, it is the first approach that can solve the “cold-start” problem in movie and TV recommendation system. Series of data mining approaches and social computing models have been adopted in this work. Similar programs found from the social network are further used to suggest programs in other media devices. This work can be easily applied in online media streaming sites in order that intelligent recommendations of programs can be made to the customers through mining microblogs.

AB  - With the increasing availability of the internet, a significant amount of data has been generated through social media. Consumer goods companies, scientists, and innovators are competing to find ways to leverage this information. Social media information is considered useful for marketers as they can directly track consumer responses to marketing campaigns, product performance, and the changes in consumer sentiment toward a brand. Many companies have also developed consumer engagement programs through social media. However, the utility of social media learning in product development seems indirect, or perhaps illusive. While many marketers are being challenged to demonstrate return on investment and many sensory and product research professionals are navigating different pathways to leverage social media information, this paper presents a fresh way of conducting the query to generate consumer and product relevant information. Coffee freshness was used as the research topic. The research here confirmed the validity of social media output. It also demonstrated the value of multi-language and cross-sectional queries. Lastly, best practices in social media research were discussed and recommendations were made regarding how to effectively include the social media tool in sensory and the product research toolbox. The authors challenge the sensory product research professionals to include social media data in their future consumer research framework. Failure to leverage social media may result in higher expenses in the cost of product development when compared to using only traditional consumer and product research tools. More importantly, researchers may miss insights that are impractical or difficult to obtain from traditional research tools.

AB  - The lexicon-based approaches to opinion mining involve the extraction of term polarities from sentiment lexicons and the aggregation of such scores to predict the overall sentiment of a piece of text. It is typically preferred where sentiment labelled data is difficult to obtain or algorithm robustness across different domains is essential. A major challenge for this approach is accounting for the semantic gap between prior polarities of terms captured by a lexicon and the terms’ polarities in a specific context (contextual polarity). This is further exacerbated by the fact that a term’s contextual polarity also depends on domains or genres in which it appears. In this paper, we introduce SmartSA, a lexicon-based sentiment classification system for social media genres which integrates strategies to capture contextual polarity from two perspectives: the interaction of terms with their textual neighbourhood (local context) and text genre (global context). We introduce an approach to hybridise a general purpose lexicon, SentiWordNet, with genre-specific vocabulary and sentiment. Evaluation results from diverse social media show that our strategies to account for local and global contexts significantly improve sentiment classification, and are complementary in combination. Our system also performed significantly better than a state-of-the-art sentiment classification system for social media, SentiStrength.

AB  - Today, the use of social networks is growing ceaselessly and rapidly. More alarming is the fact that these networks have become a substantial pool for unstructured data that belong to a host of domains, including business, governments and health. The increasing reliance on social networks calls for data mining techniques that is likely to facilitate reforming the unstructured data and place them within a systematic pattern. The goal of the present survey is to analyze the data mining techniques that were utilized by social media networks between 2003 and 2015. Espousing criterion-based research strategies, 66 articles were identified to constitute the source of the present paper. After a careful review of these articles, we found that 19 data mining techniques have been used with social media data to address 9 different research objectives in 6 different industrial and services domains. However, the data mining applications in the social media are still raw and require more effort by academia and industry to adequately perform the job. We suggest that more research be conducted by both the academia and the industry since the studies done so far are not sufficiently exhaustive of data mining techniques.

AB  - Monitoring the emergence of emerging technologies helps managers and decision makers to identify development trends in emerging technologies is crucial for government research and development (R&D), strategic planning, social investment, and enterprise practices. Researchers usually use academic papers and patent data to identify and monitoring the trends of emerging technologies from a technological perspective, but they rarely make use of social media data (e.g., such as Twitter data) related to emerging technologies. Analysis of this social media data is of great significance to understand the emergence of emerging technologies and gain insight into development trends. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that uses patent analysis and Twitter data mining to monitoring the emergence of emerging technologies and identify changing trends of these emerging technologies. The perovskite solar cell technology is selected as a case study. In this case, we used patent analysis to monitoring the evolutionary path of perovskite solar cell technology. We applied Twitter data mining to analyze Twitter users' sense of, response to, and expectations for this perovskite solar cell technology. We also identified the professional types of Twitter users and examined changes in their topics of interest over time to track the emergence of perovskite solar cell technology. We analyzed a comparison of the results of patent analysis and Twitter data mining to identify development trends of perovskite solar cell technology. This paper contributes to our understanding of how technologies emerge and develop, as well as the technology forecasting and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic technology R&D experts.

In order to better understand and exploit opinions on social media, we aim to classify users with opposite opinions on a topic for decision support. Rather than mining text content, we introduce a link-based classification model, named global consistency maximization (GCM) that partitions a social network into two classes of users with opposite opinions. Experiments on a Twitter data set show that: (1) our global approach achieves higher accuracy than two baseline approaches and (2) link-based classifiers are more robust to small training samples if selected properly.

AB  - Youth sexting, which is commonly defined as the intimate image sharing of persons under 18, is an emerging phenomenon that has garnered significant attention in South Korea and in particular, the South Korean government. Widely recognized for its potential to generate undue harm, the South Korean government has initiated a movement determined to block the participation of obscene content sharing between youths under the age of 18. While there may be different avenues to examine this phenomenon from, an approach notably absent from this list is the use of big data and data mining information produced via the dispersion of the Internet and social media. Using social big data, the study found that teenagers sexting in hopes of obtaining a higher volume of attention among friends; file sharing is more frequented than image distribution through sexting; and transactions without “adult pornography” and with “smishing” were the most influential in addressing the risks of sexting in South Korea. While big data and data mining do not make any inferences themselves, the benefits of analyzing social big data lies in its ability to incorporate a much larger volume of data and confirm the thoughts of a diverse range of participants.

AB  - There has been a lack of large-scale research examining education scholars' (professors' and doctoral students') social media participation. We address this weakness in the literature by using data mining methods to capture a large data set of scholars' participation on Twitter (232 students, 237 professors, 74,814 unique hashtags, and 645,579 tweets). We report how education scholars use Twitter, which hashtags they contribute to, and what factors predict Twitter follower counts. We also examine differences between professors and graduate students. Results (a) reveal significant variation in how education scholars participate on Twitter, (b) question purported egalitarian structures of social media use for scholarship, and (c) suggest that by focusing on the use of social media for scholarship researchers have only examined a fragment of scholars' online activities, possibly ignoring other areas of online presence. Implications of this study lead us to consider (a) the meaningfulness of alternative metrics for determining scholarly impact, (b) the impact that power structures have upon role-based differences in use (e.g. professor vs. student), and (c) the richness of scholarly identity as a construct that extends beyond formal research agendas.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is one of the prominent fields of data mining that deals with the identification and analysis of sentimental contents generally available at social media. Twitter is one of such social medias used by many users about some topics in the form of tweets. These tweets can be analyzed to find the viewpoints and sentiments of the users by using clustering-based methods. However, due to the subjective nature of the Twitter datasets, metaheuristic-based clustering methods outperforms the traditional methods for sentiment analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel metaheuristic method (CSK) which is based on K-means and cuckoo search. The proposed method has been used to find the optimum cluster-heads from the sentimental contents of Twitter dataset. The efficacy of proposed method has been tested on different Twitter datasets and compared with particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, cuckoo search, improved cuckoo search, gauss-based cuckoo search, and two n-grams methods. Experimental results and statistical analysis validate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods. The proposed method has theoretical implications for the future research to analyze the data generated through social networks/medias. This method has also very generalized practical implications for designing a system that can provide conclusive reviews on any social issues.

AB  - The conventional technologies and methods are not able to store and analyse recent data that come from different sources: various devices, sensors, networks, transactional applications, the web, and social media. Due to a complexity of data, data mining methods should be implemented using the capabilities of the Cloud technologies. In this paper, a new web-based solution named DAMIS, inspired by the Cloud, is proposed and implemented. It allows making massive data mining simpler, effective, and easily understandable for data scientists and business intelligence professionals by constructing scientific workflows for data mining using a drag and drop interface. The usage of scientific workflows allows composing convenient tools for modelling data mining processes and for simulation of real-world time- and resource-consuming data mining problems. The solution is useful to solve data classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction problems. The DAMIS architecture is designed to ensure easy accessibility, usability, scalability, and portability of the solution. The proposed solution has a wide range of applications and allows to get deep insights into the data during the process of knowledge discovery.

AB  - The analysis of the transformation and changes in scientific disciplines has always been a critical path for policymakers and researchers. The current study examines the changes in the research areas of data and information quality (DIQ). The aim of this study was to detect different types of changes occurring in the scientific areas including birth, death, growth, decline, merge, and splitting. A model has been developed for this data mining. To test the model, all DIQ articles published in online scientific citation indexing service or Web of Science (WOS) between 1970 and 2016 were extracted and analyzed using the given model. The study is related to the Big Data as well as the integration methods in Big Data which is the most important area in DIQ. It is demonstrated that the first and second emerging research areas are sub-disciplines of entity resolution and record linkage. Accordingly, linkage and privacy are the first emerging research area and the entity resolution using ontology is the second in DIQ. This is followed by the social media issues and genetic related DIQ issues.

AB  - While heightening public awareness through social media can enhance wildlife conservation and management efforts, the influence of media content and quality in relation to these efforts is poorly understood. In this study, online news and related public comments on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), one of China's flagship species, was collected and evaluated to determine the performance of media news releases in strengthening public awareness. Media releases on the incidents of dolphins straying into freshwater systems at Dongping, Beijiang, and Baisha Rivers, in the Pearl River Delta of China were examined. WeChat, the largest social networking platform in China, was used as the data source. Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to test the news popularity by publisher type, title tone, picture counts, and word counts. Content analysis (CA) was used for mining wildlife conservation information in articles and identifying public opinions. GLM results showed that three publishers (traditional, governmental and private) as well as articles with more pictures attracted greater online readerships. CA results showed that articles were unable to popularize wildlife conservation knowledge, and the public was highly doubtful about conservation efforts by the government and experts. The finding here suggests that greater attention is needed for depicting and delivering conservation knowledge (e.g., rescue methods, biological features), negative impact on wildlife by diverse human behavior, and detailed proper descriptions to promote public awareness on wildlife conservation using multi-faceted thinking so as to reduce public misunderstanding of policymakers and experts. A suggested concerted framework could help strengthen wildlife management through social media.

AB  - Big data has become an important issue for a large number of research areas such as data mining, machine learning, computational intelligence, information fusion, the semantic Web, and social networks. The rise of different big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and, more recently, Spark, for massive data processing based on the MapReduce paradigm has allowed for the efficient utilisation of data mining methods and machine learning algorithms in different domains. A number of libraries such as Mahout and SparkMLib have been designed to develop new efficient applications based on machine learning algorithms. The combination of big data technologies and traditional machine learning algorithms has generated new and interesting challenges in other areas as social media and social networks. These new challenges are focused mainly on problems such as data processing, data storage, data representation, and how data can be used for pattern mining, analysing user behaviours, and visualizing and tracking data, among others. In this paper, we present a revision of the new methodologies that is designed to allow for efficient data mining and information fusion from social media and of the new applications and frameworks that are currently appearing under the “umbrella” of the social networks, social media and big data paradigms.

AB  - In view of the substantial costs associated with classic monitoring networks, participatory data collection methods can be deemed a promising option to obtain complementary data. An emerging trend in this field is social media mining, i.e., harvesting of pre-existing, crowd-generated data from social media. Although this approach is participatory in a broader sense, the users are mostly not aware of their participation in research. Inspired by this novel development, we demonstrate in this study that it is possible to derive a water level time series from the analysis of multiple YouTube videos. As an example, we studied the recent water level rise in Dahl Hith, a Saudi Arabian cave. To do so, we screened 16 YouTube videos of the cave for suitable reference points (e.g., cave graffiti). Then, we visually estimated the distances between these points and the water level and traced their changes over time. To bridge YouTube hiatuses, we considered own photos taken during two site visits. For the time period 2013–2014, we estimate a rise of 9.5m. The fact that this rise occurred at a somewhat constant rate of roughly 0.4m per month points towards a new and permanent water source, possibly two nearby lakes formed from treated sewage effluent. An anomaly in the rising rate is noted for autumn 2013 (1.3m per month). As this increased pace coincides with a cluster of rain events, we deem rapid groundwater recharge along preferential flow paths a likely cause. Despite the sacrifice in precision, we believe that YouTube harvesting may represent a viable option to gather historical water levels in data-scarce settings and that it could be adapted to other environments (e.g., flood extents). In certain areas, it might provide an additional tool for the monitoring toolbox, thereby possibly delivering hydrological data for water resources management.

AB  - Geotagging is the process of labeling data and information with geographical identification metadata, and text mining refers to the process of deriving information from text through data analytics. Geotagging and text mining are used to mine rich sources of social media data, such as video, website, text, and Quick Response (QR) code. They have been frequently used to model consumer behaviors and market trends. This study uses both techniques to understand the resilience of infrastructure in Chennai, India using data mined from the 2015 flood. This paper presents a conceptual study on the potential use of social media (Twitter in this case) to better understand infrastructure resiliency. Using feature-extraction techniques, the research team extracted Twitter data from tweets generated by the Chennai population during the flood. First, this study shows that these techniques are useful in identifying locations, defects, and failure intensities of infrastructure using the location metadata from geotags, words containing the locations, and the frequencies of tweets from each location. However, more efforts are needed to better utilize the texts generated from the tweets, including a better understanding of the cultural contexts of the words used in the tweets, the contexts of the words used to describe the incidents, and the least frequently used words.

The structural or topological complexity or lack of it in a graph is quite often useful in understanding and more importantly, resolving the problem. We are proposing a new index we call the H0function to measure the structural/topological complexity of a graph. To do this, we introduce the concept of graph pruning and its associated algorithm that is used in the development of our measure. We illustrate the behavior of our measure, the H0 function, through different examples found in the appendix. These examples indicate that the H0 function contains information that is useful and important characteristics of a graph. Here, we restrict ourselves to undirected.

AB  - The widespread use of social media platforms allows scientists to collect huge amount of data posted by people interested in a given topic or event. This data can be analyzed to infer patterns and trends about people behaviors related to a topic or an event on a very large scale. Social media posts are often tagged with geographical coordinates or other information that allows identifying user positions, this way enabling mobility pattern analysis using trajectory mining techniques. This paper describes SMA4TD, a methodology for discovering behavior and mobility patterns of users attending large-scale public events, by analyzing social media posts. The methodology is demonstrated through two case studies. The first one is an analysis of geotagged tweets for learning the behavior of people attending the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The second one is a mobility pattern analysis on the Instagram users who visited EXPO 2015. In both cases, a very high correlation (Pearson coefficient 0.7–0.9) was measured between official attendee numbers and those produced by our analysis. This result shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and confirms its accuracy.

AB  - Socially important locations are places that are frequently visited by social media users in their social media life. Discovering socially interesting, popular or important locations from a location based social network has recently become important for recommender systems, targeted advertisement applications, and urban planning, etc. However, discovering socially important locations from a social network is challenging due to the data size and variety, spatial and temporal dimensions of the datasets, the need for developing computationally efficient approaches, and the difficulty of modeling human behavior. In the literature, several studies are conducted for discovering socially important locations. However, majority of these studies focused on discovering locations without considering historical data of social media users. They focused on analysis of data of social groups without considering each user’s preferences in these groups. In this study, we proposed a method and interest measures to discover socially important locations that consider historical user data and each user’s (individual’s) preferences. The proposed algorithm was compared with a naïve alternative using real-life Twitter dataset. The results showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the naïve alternative.

AB  - Mining the social media outlet Twitter for geolocated messages provides a rich database of information on people's thoughts and sentiments about myriad topics, like public health. Examining this spatial data has been particularly useful to researchers interested in monitoring and mapping disease outbreaks, like influenza. However, very little has been done to utilize this massive resource to examine other public health issues. This paper uses an advanced data-mining framework with a novel use of social media data retrieval and sentiment analysis to understand how geolocated tweets can be used to explore the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy food across the contiguous United States. Additionally, tweets are associated with spatial data provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) of low-income, low-access census tracts (e.g. food deserts), to examine whether tweets about unhealthy foods are more common in these disadvantaged areas. Results show that these disadvantaged census tracts tend to have both a lower proportion of tweets about healthy foods with a positive sentiment, and a higher proportion of unhealthy tweets in general. These findings substantiate the methods used by the USDA to identify regions that are at risk of having low access to healthy foods.

AB  - Healthcare is an information business with expanding use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Current ICT tools are immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange (HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise. Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices. ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.

AB  - Forest monitoring captures human impacts and other biotic and abiotic influences on forests and is a pre-requisite for the sustainable use and protection of forest ecosystems. Forest inventories for example are a key tool to plan sustainable harvesting, whereas Forest Observational Studies provide the empirical basis for an improved understanding and long-term evaluation of forest ecosystem dynamics. To that end detailed data is collected at stand level, often integrated in larger forest observational networks, which feeds into forest ecosystem models. Forests exist however in a constantly changing societal context and the direct or indirect impact of human activity has become a crucial driver on all types of ecosystems. The Millenium Ecosystem Assessment underlines the linkage between social and ecological systems, highlighting the centrality of ecosystem services to human well-being and the requirement for ecosystem monitoring in the “anthropocene” to provide a holistic view of ecosystems as social-ecological systems. Framing information about the social context of a forest ecosystem, gaining the expertise and providing resources to collect this type of information is usually outside the scope of data collection for forest inventories and monitoring. Studies in other domains faced a similar challenge and turned to data mining informal online information sources to supplement traditional monitoring and data collection strategies. This paper explores how forest monitoring approaches especially Forest Observational Studies with their long-term and large-scale focus may be complemented by social media mining. We outline (a) how social media mining methods from other domains could be applied to forest monitoring, (b) discuss identification of stakeholders, events and demands on forest ecosystems as examples of social contextual information that could be obtained via this route and (c) explain how this information could be automatically mined from social media, online news and other similar online information sources. The proposed approach is discussed on the basis of examples from a broad set of other domains.

AB  - Purpose
To investigate online search activity of suicide-related words in South Korean adolescents through data mining of social media Web sites as the suicide rate in South Korea is one of the highest in the world.
Methods
Out of more than 2.35 billion posts for 2 years from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012 on 163 social media Web sites in South Korea, 99,693 suicide-related documents were retrieved by Crawler and analyzed using text mining and opinion mining. These data were further combined with monthly employment rate, monthly rental prices index, monthly youth suicide rate, and monthly number of reported bully victims to fit multilevel models as well as structural equation models.
Results
The link from grade pressure to suicide risk showed the largest standardized path coefficient (beta = .357, p < .001) in structural models and a significant random effect (p < .01) in multilevel models. Depression was a partial mediator between suicide risk and grade pressure, low body image, victims of bullying, and concerns about disease. The largest total effect was observed in the grade pressure to depression to suicide risk. The multilevel models indicate about 27% of the variance in the daily suicide-related word search activity is explained by month-to-month variations. A lower employment rate, a higher rental prices index, and more bullying were associated with an increased suicide-related word search activity.
Conclusions
Academic pressure appears to be the biggest contributor to Korean adolescents' suicide risk. Real-time suicide-related word search activity monitoring and response system needs to be developed.

AB  - Vocal media has become a popular method of communication in today's social networks. While conveying semantic information, vocal messages usually also contain abundant emotional information; this emotional information represents a new focus for data mining in social media analytics. This paper proposes a computational method for emotion recognition and affective computing on vocal social media to estimate complex emotion as well as its dynamic changes in a three-dimensional PAD (Position–Arousal–Dominance) space; furthermore, this paper analyzes the propagation characteristics of emotions on the vocal social media site WeChat.

AB  - Information flow plays a central role in the development of transport policy, transport planning and the effective operation of the transport system. The recent upsurge in web enabled and pervasive technologies offer the opportunity of a new route for dynamic information flow that captures the views, needs and experiences of the travelling public in a timely and direct fashion through social media text posts. To date there is little published research, however, on how to realize this opportunity for the sector by capturing and analysing the text data. This paper provides an overview of the different categories of social media, the characteristics of its content and how these characteristics are reflected in transport-related posts. The research described in this paper includes a formulation of the goals for harvesting transport-related information from social media, the hypotheses to be tested to demonstrate that such information can provide valuable input to transport policy development or delivery and the challenges this involves. A hierarchical approach for categorizing transport-related information harvested from social media is presented. An explanatory study was designed, based on the understanding of the nature of social media content, the goals in harvesting it for transport planning and management purposes and existing text mining techniques. An exploratory case study is used to illustrate the process based on Twitter posts associated with particular UK sporting fixtures (i.e. football matches). The results demonstrate both the volume and pertinence of the information obtained. Whilst text-mining techniques have been applied in a number of other sectors (notably entertainment, business and the political arena), the use of information in the transport sector has some unique features that stem from both day-to-day operational practices and the longer term decision making processes surrounding the transport system – hence the significance and novelty of the results reported here. Many challenges in refining the methodology and techniques remain for future research, however the outcomes presented here are of relevance to a wide range of stakeholders in the transport and text mining fields.

AB  - Social media have been adopted by many businesses. More and more companies are using social media tools such as Facebook and Twitter to provide various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of user-generated content is freely available on social media sites. To increase competitive advantage and effectively assess the competitive environment of businesses, companies need to monitor and analyze not only the customer-generated content on their own social media sites, but also the textual information on their competitors’ social media sites. In an effort to help companies understand how to perform a social media competitive analysis and transform social media data into knowledge for decision makers and e-marketers, this paper describes an in-depth case study which applies text mining to analyze unstructured text content on Facebook and Twitter sites of the three largest pizza chains: Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Papa John's Pizza. The results reveal the value of social media competitive analysis and the power of text mining as an effective technique to extract business value from the vast amount of available social media data. Recommendations are also provided to help companies develop their social media competitive analysis strategy.

AB  - Public opinion, especially the online public opinion is a critical issue when it comes to mining its characteristics. Because it can be formed directly and intensely in a short time, and may lead to the outbreak of online group events, and the formation of online public opinion crisis. This may become the pushing hand of a public crisis event, or even have negative social impacts, which brings great challenges to the government management. Data from the mass media which reveal implicit, previously unknown, and potentially valuable information, can effectively help us to understand the evolution law of public opinion, and provide a useful reference for rumor intervention. Based on the Dynamic Network Analysis method, this paper uses ORA software to mine characteristics of public opinion information, opinion topics, and public opinion agents through a series of indicators, and quantitatively analyzed the relationships between them. The results show that through the analysis of the 8 indexes associating with opinion data mining, we can have a basic understanding of the public opinion characteristics of an opinion event, such as who is important in the opinion spreading process, the information grasping condition, and the opinion topics release situation.

AB  - Social media streams and remote sensing data have emerged as new sources for tracking disaster events, and assessing their damages. Previous studies focus on a case-by-case approach, where a specific event was first chosen and filtering criteria (e.g., keywords, spatiotemporal information) are manually designed and used to retrieve relevant data for disaster analysis. This paper presents a framework that synthesizes multi-sourced data (e.g., social media, remote sensing, Wikipedia, and Web), spatial data mining and text mining technologies to build an architecturally resilient and elastic solution to support disaster analysis of historical and future events. Within the proposed framework, Wikipedia is used as a primary source of different historical disaster events, which are extracted to build an event database. Such a database characterizes the salient spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of each type of disaster. Additionally, it can provide basic semantics, such as event name (e.g., Hurricane Sandy) and type (e.g., flooding) and spatiotemporal scopes, which are then tuned by the proposed procedures to extract additional information (e.g., hashtags for searching tweets), to query and retrieve relevant social media and remote sensing data for a specific disaster. Besides historical event analysis and pattern mining, the cloud-based framework can also support real-time event tracking and monitoring by providing on-demand and elastic computing power and storage capabilities. A prototype is implemented and tested with data relative to the 2011 Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 Colorado flooding.

AB  - Because many massive open online courses (MOOCs) have adopted social media tools for large student audiences to co-create knowledge and engage in collective learning processes, this study adopted various social media mining approaches to investigate Twitter messages related to MOOC learning. The first approach adopted in this study was calculating the important descriptive statistics of MOOC-related tweets and examining the daily, weekly, and monthly trends of MOOC that appeared on Twitter. This information can enable MOOC practitioners to observe participants’ temporal activities on social media and ascertain the most effective time to post or analyze tweets. Secondly, we investigated how public sentiment toward MOOC learning can be assessed according to related tweets. Because the availability and popularity of opinion-rich social networking services are increasing for MOOC communities, our findings from the sentiment analysis of Twitter data can afford substantial insights into participant perceptions of MOOC learning. Third, we analyzed the positive and negative retweets related to MOOCs and identified the influencers of these retweets. Social network diagrams were also developed to reveal how sentimental messages about MOOCs on Twitter were disseminated from the top influencers with the highest number of positive/negative retweets about MOOCs. Analyzing the relationships among top retweet users is vital to MOOC practitioners because they can use this information to filter or recommend MOOC-related messages to the influencers. In short, the findings pertaining social media mining in this study afford a holistic understanding of MOOC trends, public sentiment toward MOOC learning, and the influencers of MOOC-related retweets.

AB  - Micro-blogging sites such as Twitter are often considered as rich source of opinions of the masses towards products. The character length limit in tweets encourages people to use emojis, emoticons and out of vocabulary words. Due to the huge volume of tweets being generated, it is difficult to manually label tweets and create a supervised learning model for sentiment analysis. Looking into these challenges, the research paper aims to create a feature level sentiment analysis model for Twitter data mining including features such as emoji detection, spelling correction and emoticon detection. The proposed model consists of automated training data labeling by using lexicon based approach. It is an ontology based system with the domain of “Smartphone”. In addition to the general lexicon used, a set of lexicons specific for each attribute of the domain “Smartphone” are used to improve classification accuracy for training data generation. This is used to classify tweets obtained about a particular mobile phone using SVM classifier. Experimental results show that the classifier based on automated training data provides good accuracy. It also demonstrates the importance of emoji detection and the attribute specific lexicons which help improve the classification accuracy.

AB  - Companies that collect and analyze data from social media, news and other data streams are faced with several challenges that concern storage and processing of huge amounts of data. When they want to serve the processed information to their customers and moreover, when they want to cover different information needs for each customer, they need solutions that process data in near real time in order to gain insights on the data in motion. The volume and volatility of opinionated data that is published in social media, in combination with the variety of data sources has created a demanding ecosystem for stream processing. Although, there are several solutions that can handle information of static nature and small volume quite efficiently, they usually do not scale up properly because of their high complexity. Moreover, such solutions have been designed to run once or to run in a fixed dataset and they are not sufficient for processing huge volumes of streamed data. To address this problem, a platform for real-time opinion mining is proposed. Based on prior research and real application services that have been developed, a new platform called “PaloPro” is presented to cover the needs for brand monitoring.

AB  - Web 2.0 allows people to express and share their opinions about products and services they buy/use. These opinions can be expressed in various ways: numbers, texts, emoticons, pictures, videos, audios, and so on. There has been great interest in the strategies for extracting, organising and analysing this kind of information. In a social media mining framework, in particular, the use of textual data has been explored in depth and still represents a challenge. On a rating and review website, user satisfaction can be detected both from a rating scale and from the written text. However, in common practice, there is a lack of algorithms able to combine judgments provided with both comments and scores. In this paper we propose a strategy to jointly measure the user evaluations obtained from the two systems. Text polarity is detected with a sentiment-based approach, and then combined with the associated rating score. The new rating scale has a finer granularity. Moreover, also enables the reviews to be ranked. We show the effectiveness of our proposal by analysing a set of reviews about the Uffizi Gallery in Florence (Italy) published on TripAdvisor.

AB  - Social online media increasingly emerge as important informal information sources that can contribute to the detection of trends and early warnings in critical fields such as public health monitoring or emergency management. In the face of global environmental challenges the utilization of this information in ecological monitoring contexts has been called for, but examples remain sparse. This can be attributed to the significant technical challenges in processing this data and concerns about the quality, reliability and applicability of information mined from social media to the ecological domain. Here the strength and weaknesses of social media mining for ecological monitoring are assessed using the micro-blogging service Twitter and invasive alien species (IAS) monitoring as an example. The assessment is based on a manual analysis of 2842 Tweets sampled from Twitter data with potential direct or descriptive references to IAS impacting forest ecosystems, which was collected over a period of nearly three years. The results are presented as information topologies for Twitter messages of observational and non-observational character for three IAS with distinctive characteristics (Oak Processionary Moth, Emerald Ash Borer, Eastern Grey Squirrel). The results show that the social media channel Twitter is a rich source of primary and secondary observational biodiversity information. It also provides useful insights in the topical landscape of public communications on IAS as well as the public perception of IAS and IAS management. The analysis suggests broad application opportunities in IAS monitoring and management, and points at applications for related environmental questions. The results highlight that social media mining for ecological monitoring needs to be approached with the same best practices as ecological monitoring in general, requiring a good understanding of the monitored subjects and specific monitoring questions. The challenges in utilizing this information for operational systems are of technical rather than conceptual nature and include extending the degree of automation, especially with regard to image recognition and the automatic provisioning of location information.

AB  - The nature of media image, through either traditional or social media, may have an influence on public acceptance of energy technologies. The potential impact on decision-making can make media image a factor for technology market deployment, similar to technical, legal, and economic factors. Public acceptance tends to be shaped by how technologies are presented in the media. This study compares and analyses the media image of various power production technologies. Editorial and social media are analysed by using the M-Adaptive tool for media monitoring to obtain the media sentiment. The analysis is rather broad, including three million social media platforms and various news outlets in many regions and covering an enormous number of data points, from which this study has selected over 250,000 for further analysis with the help of artificial intelligence. The results indicate that public sentiment towards power production technologies varies among different technologies, and between editorial publications and social media. Editorial content is usually constructed by using news frames, whereas social media includes more emotional content from single users. A potential chain from media image to energy technology market deployment is suggested. The findings support the notion of social media having an increasing role in shaping public opinion, which may need to be acknowledged to a larger extent.

AB  - As the microblogging services are becoming more prosperous in everyday life for users on Online Social Networks (OSNs), it is more favorable for hot topics and breaking news to gain more attraction very soon than ever before, which are so-called “super-spreading events”. In the information diffusion process of these super-spreading events, messages are passed on from one user to another and numerous individuals are influenced by a relatively small portion of users, a.k.a. super-spreaders. Acquiring an awareness of super-spreading phenomena and an understanding of patterns of wide-ranged information propagations benefits several social media data mining tasks, such as hot topic detection, predictions of information propagation, harmful information monitoring and intervention. Taking into account that super-spreading in both information diffusion and spread of a contagious disease are analogous, in this study, we build a parameterized model, the SAIR model, based on well-known epidemic models to characterize super-spreading phenomenon in tweet information propagation accompanied with super-spreaders. For the purpose of modeling information diffusion, empirical observations on a real-world Weibo dataset are statistically carried out. Both the steady-state analysis on the equilibrium and the validation on real-world Weibo dataset of the proposed model are conducted. The case study that validates the proposed model shows that the SAIR model is much more promising than the conventional SIR model in characterizing a super-spreading event of information propagation. In addition, numerical simulations are carried out and discussed to discover how sensitively the parameters affect the information propagation process.

AB  - Social media has generated a wealth of data. Billions of people tweet, sharing, post, and discuss everyday. Due to this increased activity, social media platforms provide new opportunities for research about human behavior, information diffusion, and influence propagation at a scale that is otherwise impossible. Social media data is a new treasure trove for data mining and predictive analytics. Since social media data differs from conventional data, it is imperative to study its unique characteristics. This work investigates data collection bias associated with social media. In particular, we propose computational methods to assess if there is bias due to the way a social media site makes its data available, to detect bias from data samples without access to the full data, and to mitigate bias by designing data collection strategies that maximize coverage to minimize bias. We also present a new kind of data bias stemming from API attacks with both algorithms, data, and validation results. This work demonstrates how some characteristics of social media data can be extensively studied and verified and how corresponding intervention mechanisms can be designed to overcome negative effects. The methods and findings of this work could be helpful in studying different characteristics of social media data.

AB  - In this paper we present a methodology to assess moviegoers' early reactions to movies' premieres through the extraction of analytics from Twitter conversations that take place in the weekend in which a movie is released. We then apply data mining techniques to a sample of 22 movies to identify models able to predict box-office sales in the first weekend. We show that better predictions are obtained when traffic metrics are combined with social network or conversational indicators rather than with sentiment and that online sentiment achieves the lowest explanatory power among all the considered variables. Our findings confirm that the importance of commonly used buzz-metrics, such as sentiment, is probably overstated, and that conversational analytics can contribute significantly to explain the variance of box office revenues in the first week end of release. More broadly, our work adds to research on information diffusion in online networks by providing evidence that diffusion of messages is not content-neutral and that the analysis of conversational dynamics can help to understand the interplay between collective generation and diffusion of content in social networks as well as to obtain insights on whether information diffusion influences off-line behavior.

AB  - E-marketing is the concentration of all efforts in terms of adapting and developing marketing strategies into the virtual spaces: web, social media… In an e-commerce site, e-marketing must help consumers in their purchase. This requires precise knowledge of the customer's preferences. For this reason, holders of e-shops must find out to whom, to what, how and when to refer to the customer, ergo, to know the “consumer decision journey” and strengthen their engagement. This analysis is obtained when the customer is visiting an e-shop because (s)he leaves a digital footprint that can be used to understand his/her needs, desires and demands as well as to improve web presence. These data can be used for data mining to understand the e-marketing and selling processes in a better way. In this paper a survey of 86 e-shops in Spain is presented. In the conclusions, some ideas for good e-marketing practices related to the buying behaviour analysis of customers are shown. Hence, new trends in e-marketing are suggested from a strategic, tactical and operational level in which different data mining techniques ease the purchase and the engagement.

AB  - This paper uses a multimodal mixed methods approach for exploring general recontextualisation patterns of violent extremist images in online media. Specifically, the paper reports on the preliminary findings of a preliminary study which investigates various patterns in the reuse of images which appear in ISIS’s official propaganda magazines Dabiq and Rumiyah by others across various public online media platforms (e.g. news websites, social media news aggregates, blogs). Using a mixed methods approach informed by multimodal discourse analysis, and combined with data mining and information visualisation, the study addresses questions such as which types of images produced and used by ISIS in its propaganda magazines recirculate most frequently in other online media over time, on which types of online media these images reappear, and in which contexts they are used and reused on these websites, that is that is, whether the tone of the message is corporate (formal) or personal (informal). Preliminary findings from the study suggest different recontextualisation patterns for certain types of ISIS-related images of over time. The study also found that the majority of violent extremist images used in the sample analysis appear to circulate most frequently on Western news and politics websites and news aggregate platforms, in predominantly formal contexts.

AB  - Through the perspective of tourism, a city as a tourist destination usually consists of multiple tourist attractions such as natural or cultural scenic spots. These attractions scatter in city spaces following some specific forms: clustered in some regions and dispersed in others. It is known that users organize their tours in a city not only according to the distance between different attractions but also according to other factors such as time constraints, expenses, interests, and the similarities between different attractions. Hence, users' travel tours can help us gain a better understanding about the relationships among different attractions at the city scale. In this paper, a methodological framework is developed to detect tourists' spatial-temporal behaviors from social media data, and then such information is used to extract and analyze city's tourism districts. We believe that this city space division will make significant contributions to the fields of urban planning, tourism facility providing, and scenery area constructing. A typical tourism city in China—Huangshan—is selected as our study area for experiments.

AB  - The PM2.5 problem is proving to be a major public crisis and is of great public-concern requiring an urgent response. Information about, and prediction of PM2.5 from the perspective of atmospheric dynamic theory is still limited due to the complexity of the formation and development of PM2.5. In this paper, we attempted to realize the relevance analysis and short-term prediction of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing, China, using multi-source data mining. A correlation analysis model of PM2.5 to physical data (meteorological data, including regional average rainfall, daily mean temperature, average relative humidity, average wind speed, maximum wind speed, and other pollutant concentration data, including CO, NO2, SO2, PM10) and social media data (microblog data) was proposed, based on the Multivariate Statistical Analysis method. The study found that during these factors, the value of average wind speed, the concentrations of CO, NO2, PM10, and the daily number of microblog entries with key words ‘Beijing; Air pollution’ show high mathematical correlation with PM2.5 concentrations. The correlation analysis was further studied based on a big data's machine learning model- Back Propagation Neural Network (hereinafter referred to as BPNN) model. It was found that the BPNN method performs better in correlation mining. Finally, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (hereinafter referred to as ARIMA) Time Series model was applied in this paper to explore the prediction of PM2.5 in the short-term time series. The predicted results were in good agreement with the observed data. This study is useful for helping realize real-time monitoring, analysis and pre-warning of PM2.5 and it also helps to broaden the application of big data and the multi-source data mining methods.

AB  - The IT advancement facilitates growth of social media networks, which allow consumers to exchange information online. As a result, a vast amount of user-generated data is freely available via Internet. These data, in the raw format, are qualitative, unstructured and highly subjective thus they do not generate any direct value for the business. Given this potentially useful database it is beneficial to unlock knowledge it contains. This however is a challenge, which this study aims to address. This paper proposes an ANN-based approach to analyse user-generated comments from social media. The first mechanism of the approach is to map comments against predefined product attributes. The second mechanism is to generate input-output models which are used to statistically address the significant relationship between attributes and comment length. The last mechanism employs Artificial Neural Networks to formulate such a relationship, and determine the constitution of rich comments. The application of proposed approach is demonstrated with a case study, which reveals the effectiveness of the proposed approach for assessing product performance. Recommendations are provided and direction for future studies in social media data mining is marked.

AB  - Location-based social media provide an enormous stream of data about humans' life and behavior. With geospatial methods, those data can offer rich insights into public health. In this research, we study the effect of climate and seasonality on the prevalence of depression in Twitter users in the U.S. Text mining and geospatial methods are used to detect tweets related to depression and their spatiotemporal patterns at the scale of Metropolitan Statistical Area. We find the relationship between depression rates, climate risk factors and seasonality are varied and geographically localized. The same climate measure may have opposite association with depression rates at different places. Relative humidity, temperature, sea level pressure, precipitation, snowfall, weed speed, globe solar radiation, and length of day all contribute to the geographic variations of depression rates. A conceptual compact map is designed to visualize scattered geographic phenomena in a large area. We also propose a three-stage framework that semi-automatically detects and analyzes geographically distributed health issues using location-based social media data.

AB  - Online social games are becoming a significant component in today's social media sites. The social networking sites environment has provided a platform for online games to develop and expand in the virtual medium. Users are now able to play games online, compare scores, and challenge each other among many other things. Due to the diverse user demographics of social media sites, various motivations to playing social games emerge. The need for this present research was to answer the question whether the integration of social games within social networking sites and apps have increased the likelihood of playing those games. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to predict from the fact that will be used to decide whether to include games (Adventure, Fighting, Design\Art, Virtual Life…etc.) in the social media sites that still have not been implemented (such as Twitter, Tumblr, etc.). Also, we want to discover whether the inclusion of social games has improved the services offered by social sites and whether social gaming has effects on human behavior with regards to socializing and interacting with others. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between social media apps and games, and whether the former has increased users participation in online games. The primary setting for the quantitative method of research study was the online gamers regardless their age, gender, and interests. The data were collected by distributing an online survey, and were analyzed using WEKA data mining tool. Two popular classification algorithms were used to predict the answer of this research question. The resulting data were compared and tested for their accuracy using different metrics.

This paper describes an approach to analyze geotagged social media data from Twitter to characterize spatial, temporal and demographic features of tourist flows in Cilento - a regional tourist attraction in southern Italy. It demonstrates how the analysis of geotagged social media data yields more detailed spatial, temporal and demographic information of tourist movements, in comparison to the current understanding of tourist flows in the region. The insights obtained from our case study illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology yet attention should be paid to biases in the data as well as methodological limitations when drawing conclusions from analytical results.

AB  - Social media data have recently attracted considerable attention as an emerging voice of the customer as it has rapidly become a channel for exchanging and storing customer-generated, large-scale, and unregulated voices about products. Although product planning studies using social media data have used systematic methods for product planning, their methods have limitations, such as the difficulty of identifying latent product features due to the use of only term-level analysis and insufficient consideration of opportunity potential analysis of the identified features. Therefore, an opportunity mining approach is proposed in this study to identify product opportunities based on topic modeling and sentiment analysis of social media data. For a multifunctional product, this approach can identify latent product topics discussed by product customers in social media using topic modeling, thereby quantifying the importance of each product topic. Next, the satisfaction level of each product topic is evaluated using sentiment analysis. Finally, the opportunity value and improvement direction of each product topic from a customer-centered view are identified by an opportunity algorithm based on product topics’ importance and satisfaction. We expect that our approach for product planning will contribute to the systematic identification of product opportunities from large-scale customer-generated social media data and will be used as a real-time monitoring tool for changing customer needs analysis in rapidly evolving product environments.

Results
Twelve articles were included in the main analysis: 7 from Twitter with 1 also including Weibo, 1 from Facebook, 3 from YouTube, and 1 from Instagram and Flickr. All the studies were cross-sectional. Eleven of the 12 articles studied ≥ 1of these 3 elements of social media and their relationships: themes or topics of social media contents, meta-data of social media posts (such as frequency of original posts and reposts, and impressions) and characteristics of the social media accounts that made these posts (such as whether they are individuals or institutions). One article studied how news videos influenced Twitter traffic. Twitter content analysis methods included text mining (n = 3) and manual coding (n = 1). Two studies involved mathematical modeling. All 3 YouTube studies and the Instagram/Flickr study used manual coding of videos and images, respectively.
Conclusions
Published Ebola virus disease-related social media research focused on Twitter and YouTube. The utility of social media research to public health practitioners is warranted.

AB  - Extraction of Emotions from Multilingual Text posted on social media by different categories of users is one of the crucial tasks in the field of opining mining and sentiment analysis. Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources. Furthermore, the presented work for extraction of emotion from tweets performs better in comparisons of other popular sentiment analysis techniques which are dependent of specific existing affect lexicons.

AB  - Currently, Nearest-Neighbor approaches (NN) have been applied to large scale real world image data mining. However, the following three disadvantages prevent them from wider application compared to other machine learning methods: (i) the performance is inferior on small datasets; (ii) the performance will degrade for data with high dimensions; (iii) they are heavily dependent on the chosen feature and distance measure. In this paper, we try to overcome the three mentioned intrinsic weaknesses by taking the abundant and diversified content of social media images into account. Firstly, we propose a novel neighborhood similarity measure which encodes both the local density information and semantic information, thus it has better generalization power than the original image-to-image similarity. Secondly, to enhance the scalability, we adopt kernelized Locality Sensitive Hashing (KLSH) to conduct approximated nearest neighbor search by utilizing a set of kernels calculated on several complementary image features. Finally, to enhance the robustness on diversified genres of images, we propose to fuse the discrimination power of different features by combining multiple neighborhood similarities calculated on different features/kernels with the entire retrieved nearest labeled and unlabeled image via the hashing systems. Experimental results on visual categorization on the Caltech-256 and two social media databases show the advantage of our method over traditional NN methods using the labeled data only.

AB  - The amount of information available in the Internet has an exponential growth and therefore, obtaining appropriate information from such a huge repository is an indispensable yet complicated task. As the structuring of web pages is diverse across websites, there is no “one size fits all” technique to perform web data extraction. It results in the need for devising a technique that is independent of structuring of web pages, which is addressed in this paper by identifying informative content through semantic analysis rather than syntactic structure. Social web forums contain web pages which are generated using server-side templates and the information present in such websites has wide variety of applications like opinion mining, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, trend analysis etc. Of the social media forums, health discussion forums play a crucial role and analyzing data extracted from such medical forums find its application in disease detection based on symptoms, determining adverse drug reactions, suggestion of clinical tests for diseases and so on. In this paper, a fully automated technique for extracting posts from various Medical Forum Websites has been devised and it performs well for differently structured web pages belonging to diverse forum websites. Since, the technique is based on semantic features, it can be applied to other social web forums as well.

AB  - To quickly grasp what interesting topics are happening on web, it is challenge to discover and describe topics from User-Generated Content (UGC) data. Describing topics by probable keywords and prototype images is an efficient human-machine interaction to help person quickly grasp a topic. However, except for the challenges from web topic detection, mining the multi-media description is a challenge task that the conventional approaches can barely handle: (1) noises from non-informative short texts or images due to less-constrained UGC; and (2) even for these informative images, the gaps between visual concepts and social ones. This paper addresses above challenges from the perspective of background similarity remove, and proposes a two-step approach to mining the multi-media description from noisy data. First, we utilize a devcovolution model to strip the similarities among non-informative words/images during web topic detection. Second, the background-removed similarities are reconstructed to identify the probable keywords and prototype images during topic description. By removing background similarities, we can generate coherent and informative multi-media description for a topic. Experiments show that the proposed method produces a high quality description on two public datasets.

AB  - This study presents a research approach using data mining for predicting the performance metrics of posts published in brands' Facebook pages. Twelve posts' performance metrics extracted from a cosmetic company's page including 790 publications were modeled, with the two best results achieving a mean absolute percentage error of around 27%. One of them, the “Lifetime Post Consumers” model, was assessed using sensitivity analysis to understand how each of the seven input features influenced it (category, page total likes, type, month, hour, weekday, paid). The type of content was considered the most relevant feature for the model, with a relevance of 36%. A status post captures around twice the attention of the remaining three types (link, photo, video). We have drawn a decision process flow from the “Lifetime Post Consumers” model, which by complementing the sensitivity analysis information may be used to support manager's decisions on whether to publish a post.

AB  - Social media has been playing an increasingly important role in the sharing of individuals' opinions on many financial issues, including credit risk in investment decisions. This paper analyzes whether these opinions, which are transmitted through social media, can accurately predict enterprises' future credit risk. We consider financial statements oriented evaluation results based on logit and probit approaches as the benchmarks. We then conduct textual analysis to retrieve both posts and their corresponding commentaries published on two of the most popular social media platforms for financial investors in China. Professional advice from financial analysts is also investigated in this paper. We surprisingly find that the opinions extracted from both posts and commentaries surpass opinions of analysts in terms of credit risk prediction.

AB  - Motivation
Prescribing cascade (PC) occurs when an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is misinterpreted as a new medical condition, leading to further prescriptions for treatment. Additional prescriptions, however, may worsen the existing condition or introduce additional adverse effects (AEs). Timely detection and prevention of detrimental PCs is essential as drug AEs are among the leading causes of hospitalization and deaths. Identifying detrimental PCs would enable warnings and contraindications to be disseminated and assist the detection of unknown drug AEs. Nonetheless, the detection is difficult and has been limited to case reports or case assessment using administrative health claims data. Social media is a promising source for detecting signals of detrimental PCs due to the public availability of many discussions regarding treatments and drug AEs.
Objective
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting detrimental PCs from social media.
Methods
The detection, however, is challenging due to the data uncertainty and data rarity in social media. We propose a framework to mine sequences of drugs and AEs that signal detrimental PCs, taking into account the data uncertainty and data rarity.
Results
We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets collected from Twitter and Patient health forum. Our framework achieves encouraging results in the validation against known detrimental PCs (F1=78% for Twitter and 68% for Patient) and the detection of unknown potential detrimental PCs (Precision@50=72% and NDCG@50=95% for Twitter, Precision@50=86% and NDCG@50=98% for Patient). In addition, the framework is efficient and scalable to large datasets.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates the feasibility of generating hypotheses of detrimental PCs from social media to reduce pharmacists’ guesswork.

AB  - Tracking global and regional conflict zones requires spatially explicit information in near real-time. Here, we examined the potential of remote sensing time-series data (night lights) and big data (data mining of news events and Flickr photos) for monitoring and understanding crisis development and refugee flows. We used the recent Arab Spring as a case study, and examined temporal trends in monthly time series of variables which we hypothesized to indicate conflict intensity, covering all Arab countries. Both Flickr photos and night-time lights proved as sensitive indicators for loss of economic and human capital, and news items from the Global Data on Events, Location and Tone (GDELT) project on fight events were positively correlated with actual deaths from conflicts. We propose that big data and remote sensing datasets have potential to provide disaggregated and timely data on conflicts where official statistics are lacking, offering an effective approach for monitoring geopolitical and environmental changes on Earth.

AB  - Serious games present a relatively new approach to training and education for international organizations such as NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Although serious games are often deployed as stand-alone solutions, they can also serve as entry points into a comprehensive training pipeline in which content is delivered via different media to rapidly scale immersive training and education for mass audiences. The present paper introduces a new paradigm for more effective and scalable training and education called transmedia learning. Transmedia learning leverages several new media trends including the peer communications of social media, the scalability of massively openonline course (MOOCs), and the design of transmedia storytelling used by entertainment, advertising, and commercial game industries to sustain audience engagement. Transmedia learning is defined as the scalable system of messages representing a narrative or core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media, emotionally engaging learners by involving them personally in the story. In the present paper, we introduce the transmedia learning paradigm as offering more effective use of serious games for training and education. This approach is consistent with the goals of international organizations implementing approaches similar to those described by the Army Learning Model (ALM) to deliver training and education to Soldiers across multiple media. We discuss why the human brain is wired for transmedia learning and demonstrate how the Simulation Experience Design Method can be used to create transmedia learning story worlds for serious games. We describe how social media interactions and MOOCs may be used in transmedia learning, and how data mining social media and experience tracking can inform the development of computational learner models for transmedia learning campaigns. Examples of how the U.S. Army has utilized transmedia campaigns for strategic communication and game-based training are provided. Finally, we provide strategies the reader can use today to incorporate transmedia storytelling elements such as Internet, serious games, video, social media, graphic novels, machinima, blogs, and alternate reality gaming into a new paradigm for training and education: transmedia learning.

AB  - The use of social networks has grown noticeably in recent years and this fact has led to the production of numerous volumes of data. Data that are widely used by users on the social media sites are very large, noisy, unstructured and dynamic. Providing a flexible framework and method to apply in all of these networks can be the perfect solution. The uncertainties arising from the complexity of decisions in recognition of the Tie Strength among people have led researchers to seek effective variables of intimacy among people. Since there are several effective variables which their effectiveness rate are not precisely determined and their relations are nonlinear and complex, using data mining techniques can be considered as one of the practical solutions for this problem. Some types of unsupervised mining methods have been conducted in the field of detecting the type of tie. Data mining could be considered as one of the applicable tools for researchers in exploring the relationships among users. In this paper, the problem of tie strength prediction is modeled as a data mining problem on which different supervised and unsupervised mining methods are applicable. We propose a comprehensive study on the effects of using different classification techniques such as decision trees, Naive Bayes and so on; in addition to some ensemble classification methods such as Bagging and Boosting methods for predicting tie strength of users of a social network. LinkedIn social network is used as a real case study and our experimental results are proposed on its extracted data. Several models, based on basic techniques and ensemble methods are created and their efficiencies are compared based on F-Measure, accuracy, and average executing time. Our experimental results show that, our profile-behavioral based model has much better accuracy in comparison with profile-data based models techniques.

AB  - The global extraction of minerals is commonly located in areas populated by indigenous people; and while conflicts between multinational corporations and local activists and indigenous people are widespread today, the understanding of their dynamics are lacking. The Swedish government’s encouragement to an expanding mining industry has caused resistance due to environmental and social implications, particularly its effect on Sámi reindeer husbandry. The resistance to a mine in Gállok is based on the belief that the right to decide about land use historically falls on the Sámi people, and the right to affect land use is detrimental for the survival of Sámi culture and reindeer husbandry. Although the conflict may be perceived as concerning access to natural resources, we argue that the perceived environmental conflict can be viewed as part of a larger struggle over social status and recognition. Data have been collected using qualitative methods such as observations, interviews and documents. The subsequent analysis relies on a meta-theoretical framework of justice as recognition using a typology of relations of power. Our findings suggest that relations of power constitute different categories of social actors. Stakeholders like the Sámi population are subordinated to more dominant stakeholders such as the government, the company and media, who have ‘more’ power or ‘different’ kinds of power ‘over’ others. Through these asymmetric power relations, historical state-Sámi relations are continuously reproduced within prevailing institutions, and also in this mining conflict. Interviewees from business and the municipality testified to the discourses driven by a neoliberal and profit-focused worldview. Challenging the neoliberal discourse, other stakeholders, namely civil society and Sámi, expressed an alternative discourse based on a local, traditional, cultural, environmental and anti-neoliberal worldview.

AB  - The author explored spectators’ emotional reactions manifested on social media. By using Twitter search application programming interface, 328,000 real-time tweets posted by fans of the Panthers and the Broncos during the Super Bowl 50 game were collected. The lexicon-based text mining approach (a big data analysis in social media analytics) was employed to classify tweets into five different emotions. The findings indicated that spectators expressed positive emotions when their team scored; conversely, they expressed negative emotions when the opposite team scored. Interestingly, spectators became habituated with each subsequent score from either of their preferred teams, which resulted in fewer expressions of emotions. However, when a team scored soon after the opposite team scored, fans expressed a surge of positive or negative emotions, accordingly. The results supported both the theories of affective disposition and opponent-process. Spectators’ simultaneous experience of positive and negative emotions may contribute to fans’ satisfaction, continued patronage, and mental health.

AB  - In the era of Web 2.0, there has been an explosive growth of consumer-contributed comments at social media and electronic commerce Web sites. Applying state-of-the-art social analytics methodology to analyze the sentiments embedded in these consumer comments facilitates both firms' product design strategies and individual consumers' comparison shopping. However, existing social analytics methods often adopt coarse-grained and context-free sentiment analysis approaches. Consequently, these methods may not be effective enough to support firms and consumers' demands of fine-grained extraction of market intelligence from social media. Guided by the design science research methodology, the main contribution of our research is the design of a novel social analytics methodology that can leverage the sheer volume of consumer reviews archived at social media sites to perform a fine-grained extraction of market intelligence. More specifically, the proposed social analytics methodology is underpinned by a novel semi-supervised fuzzy product ontology mining algorithm. Evaluated based on real-world social media data, our prototype system shows remarkable performance improvement over a baseline ontology learning system and a context-free sentiment analysis system. The managerial implication of our research is that firms can apply the proposed social analytics methodology to tap into the collective social intelligence on the Web, and hence improve their product design and marketing strategies.

AB  - Large-scale text categorisation in social environments, characterised by the high dimensionality of feature spaces, is one of the most relevant problems in machine learning and data mining nowadays. Short-texts, which are posted at unprecedented rates, accentuate both the importance of learning tasks and the challenges posed by such large feature space. A collection of social media short-texts does not only provide textual information but also topological information given by the relationships between posts and their authors. The linked nature of social data causes new complementary data dimensions to be added to the feature space, which, at the same time, becomes sparser. Additionally, in the context of social media, posts usually arrive simultaneously in streams, which hinders the deployment of efficient traditional feature selection techniques that assume a feature space fully known in advance. Hence, efficient and scalable online feature selection becomes an important requirement in numerous large-scale social applications. This work presents an online feature selection technique for high-dimensional data based on the integration of two information sources, social and content-based, for the real-time classification of short-text streams coming from social media. It focuses on discovering implicit relations amongst new posts, already known ones and their corresponding authors to identify groups of socially related posts. Then, each discovered group is represented by a set of non-redundant and relevant textual features. Finally, such features are used to train different learning models for classifying newly arriving posts. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world short-texts demonstrate that the proposed approach helps to improve classification results when compared to state-of-the-art and traditional online feature selection techniques.

AB  - Objectives
The role of social media in biomedical knowledge mining, including clinical, medical and healthcare informatics, prescription drug abuse epidemiology and drug pharmacology, has become increasingly significant in recent years. Social media offers opportunities for people to share opinions and experiences freely in online communities, which may contribute information beyond the knowledge of domain professionals. This paper describes the development of a novel semantic web platform called PREDOSE (PREscription Drug abuse Online Surveillance and Epidemiology), which is designed to facilitate the epidemiologic study of prescription (and related) drug abuse practices using social media. PREDOSE uses web forum posts and domain knowledge, modeled in a manually created Drug Abuse Ontology (DAO – pronounced dow), to facilitate the extraction of semantic information from User Generated Content (UGC), through combination of lexical, pattern-based and semantics-based techniques. In a previous study, PREDOSE was used to obtain the datasets from which new knowledge in drug abuse research was derived. Here, we report on various platform enhancements, including an updated DAO, new components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content analysis, trend detection and emerging patterns exploration, which enhance the capabilities of the PREDOSE platform. Given these enhancements, PREDOSE is now more equipped to impact drug abuse research by alleviating traditional labor-intensive content analysis tasks.
Methods
Using custom web crawlers that scrape UGC from publicly available web forums, PREDOSE first automates the collection of web-based social media content for subsequent semantic annotation. The annotation scheme is modeled in the DAO, and includes domain specific knowledge such as prescription (and related) drugs, methods of preparation, side effects, and routes of administration. The DAO is also used to help recognize three types of data, namely: (1) entities, (2) relationships and (3) triples. PREDOSE then uses a combination of lexical and semantic-based techniques to extract entities and relationships from the scraped content, and a top-down approach for triple extraction that uses patterns expressed in the DAO. In addition, PREDOSE uses publicly available lexicons to identify initial sentiment expressions in text, and then a probabilistic optimization algorithm (from related research) to extract the final sentiment expressions. Together, these techniques enable the capture of fine-grained semantic information, which facilitate search, trend analysis and overall content analysis using social media on prescription drug abuse. Moreover, extracted data are also made available to domain experts for the creation of training and test sets for use in evaluation and refinements in information extraction techniques.
Results
A recent evaluation of the information extraction techniques applied in the PREDOSE platform indicates 85% precision and 72% recall in entity identification, on a manually created gold standard dataset. In another study, PREDOSE achieved 36% precision in relationship identification and 33% precision in triple extraction, through manual evaluation by domain experts. Given the complexity of the relationship and triple extraction tasks and the abstruse nature of social media texts, we interpret these as favorable initial results. Extracted semantic information is currently in use in an online discovery support system, by prescription drug abuse researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) at Wright State University.
Conclusion
A comprehensive platform for entity, relationship, triple and sentiment extraction from such abstruse texts has never been developed for drug abuse research. PREDOSE has already demonstrated the importance of mining social media by providing data from which new findings in drug abuse research were uncovered. Given the recent platform enhancements, including the refined DAO, components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content, trend and emerging pattern analysis, it is expected that PREDOSE will play a significant role in advancing drug abuse epidemiology in future.

AB  - With the rising popularity of social media in the context of environments based on the Internet of things (IoT), semantic information has emerged as an important bridge to connect human intelligence with heterogeneous media big data. As a critical tool to improve media big data retrieval, semantic fusion encounters a number of challenges: the manual method is inefficient, and the automatic approach is inaccurate. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a solution called CSF (Crowdsourcing Semantic Fusion) that makes full use of the collective wisdom of social users and introduces crowdsourcing computing to semantic fusion. First, the correlation of cross-modal semantics is mined and the semantic objects are normalized for fusion. Second, we employ the dimension reduction and relevance feedback approaches to reduce non-principal components and noise. Finally, we research the storage and distribution mechanism. Experiment results highlight the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. The proposed method is an effective and practical cross-modal semantic fusion and distribution mechanism for heterogeneous social media, provides a novel idea for social media semantic processing, and uses an interactive visualization framework for social media knowledge mining and retrieval to improve semantic knowledge and the effect of representation.

AB  - Objectives
The goals of this study were to examine the feasibility of using ontology-based text mining with CaringBridge social media journal entries in order to understand journal content from a whole-person perspective. Specific aims were to describe Omaha System problem concept frequencies in the journal entries over a four-step process overall, and relative to Omaha System Domains; and to examine the four step method including the use of standardized terms and related words.
Design
Ontology-based retrospective observational feasibility study using text mining methods.
Sample
A corpus of social media text consisting of 13,757,900 CaringBridge journal entries from June 2006 to June 2016.
Measures
The Omaha System terms, including problems and signs/symptoms, were used as the foundational lexicon for this study. Development of an extended lexicon with related words for each problem concept expanded the semantics-powered data analytics approach to reflect consumer word choices.
Results
All Omaha System problem concepts were identified in the journal entries, with consistent representation across domains. The approach was most successful when common words were used to represent clinical terms. Preliminary validation of journal examples showed appropriate representation of the problem concepts.
Conclusions
This is the first study to evaluate the feasibility of using an interface terminology and ontology (the Omaha System) as a text mining information model. Further research is needed to systematically validate these findings, refine the process as needed to advance the study of CaringBridge content, and extend the use of this method to other consumer-generated journal entries and terminologies.

AB  - Hyper-resolution datasets for urban flooding are rare. This problem prevents detailed flooding risk analysis, urban flooding control, and the validation of hyper-resolution numerical models. We employed social media and crowdsourcing data to address this issue. Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision techniques are applied to the data collected from Twitter and MyCoast (a crowdsourcing app). We found these big data based flood monitoring approaches can complement the existing means of flood data collection. The extracted information is validated against precipitation data and road closure reports to examine the data quality. The two data collection approaches are compared and the two data mining methods are discussed. A series of suggestions is given to improve the data collection strategy.

AB  - The impact of Social media and SMS is increasing in our daily lives. These sources provide the analysts with large amount of text data for data mining and finding patterns. However, this data is notoriously noisy as people use lot of short hand language and hence destroying its utility for analyzing. Hence, it is important to convert this noisy text into Standard English. In this paper, we target the not-in-vocabulary (NIV) words present in these sources and propose a method to identify and normalize these NIV words. Complied databases and context are exploited to replace the ill-formed words and select the best possible correction for that word. This method can also replace internet slang into pure English and correct the spelling errors made to some extent.

AB  - Cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in the Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) population. AYA cancer survivors face unique challenges, particularly social–psychological impacts in identity development, coping, distress, and social relationships. Given the high prevalence of Internet use and social media engagement, AYA survivors and clinicians and organizations charged with their care are increasingly turning to social media and other technology-mediated platforms. While there has been limited empirical evidence on the utility of social media in addressing AYA survivors’ needs, the last 5–6 years have experienced a growth in online, technology-mediated advocacy, and patient organizations and related publications. This review highlights key research and practical efforts, their impacts to date, and discusses future directions.

AB  - Background
Twitter can address the challenges of the current Ebola outbreak surveillance. The aims of this study are to demonstrate the use of Twitter as a real-time method of Ebola outbreak surveillance to monitor information spread, capture early epidemic detection, and examine content of public knowledge and attitudes.
Methods
We collected tweets mentioning Ebola in English during the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak from July 24-August 1, 2014. Our analysis for this observational study includes time series analysis with geologic visualization to observe information dissemination and content analysis using natural language processing to examine public knowledge and attitudes.
Results
A total of 42,236 tweets (16,499 unique and 25,737 retweets) mentioning Ebola were posted and disseminated to 9,362,267,048 people, 63 times higher than the initial number. Tweets started to rise in Nigeria 3-7 days prior to the official announcement of the first probable Ebola case. The topics discussed in tweets include risk factors, prevention education, disease trends, and compassion.
Conclusion
Because of the analysis of a unique Twitter dataset captured in the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak, our results provide insight into the intersection of social media and public health outbreak surveillance. Findings demonstrate the usefulness of Twitter mining to inform public health education.

AB  - The huge amount of user generated content about the real world events are generated by social media for every minute. Twitter has gained tremendous popularity for the past few years with millions of tweets for each day. The twitter data can be monitored through the Twitter Streaming API in order to reveal model, benefit and to analyze user behavior. This is the major advantage in this micro-blogging network which is suitable for data mining. In this paper, self-built Twitter dataset are prepared based on event which are reflected in social media and related images of these event are stored in the image database. One goal of this paper is to discover the keyword from the extracted tweets using pre-processing steps. A new proposed HOG_SIFT features are obtained to extract the features of images related to the keyword detection and this is the second goal of our work. The third goal is to retrieve the significant images from the image database based on subspace clustering techniques such as k-subspace and seq-k-subspace algorithms. It is experimentally found that proposed HOG_SIFT feature extraction method is efficient and gives better performance than SIFT method. Similarly clustering algorithms are compared based on the performance measures such as precision, recall and accuracy. It is proved that seq-k-subspace performance better than the k-subspace clustering algorithm.

AB  - Recent research has identified a relatively new trend among youth (12–24) living in violent urban neighborhoods. These youth use social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to brag about violence, make threats, recruit gang members and to plan criminal activity known as Internet banging. Studies have typically examined youth communication by mining data on social media and surveying or interviewing youth about their social media behaviors. However, there is little to no empirical research that examines how adults who work directly with youth in violent, urban neighborhoods shape, conceptualize and intervene in urban-based youth violence facilitated by social media. Utilizing qualitative interviews with violence outreach workers, we asked outreach workers to describe how youth use social media and the extent to which they use social media to intervene in crisis that emerge in violent Chicago neighborhoods. Participants describe youth behavior that included taunting rival gangs, posturing and boasting about violent events. We also found evidence that social media enhanced crisis intervention work in violent neighborhoods when coupled with close, trusting relationships with youth.

AB  - Smog disasters are becoming more and more frequent and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas. Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people׳s reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard. In addition, this forecasting approach can provide decision support for smog-related health hazard management through functions like early warning.

AB  - Recently there has been much interest in electronic commerce applications that use data mining techniques to explore datasets in the social media context. However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog’s description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user’s sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact.

AB  - In current era of big data, a wide variety of high-volume data having different veracity can be easily collected or generated at a high velocity. Social network data, as well as audio and video in social media and social networking sites, are examples of big data. Embedded in these big data are valuable information and knowledge. To discovery this implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information and knowledge from these big data, some big data science solutions are in demand. In this paper, we explore big data mining techniques for detecting outliers or anomalies from YouTube video viewing history and data-cleaning this viewing log so that the user-preferred YouTube viewing patterns or trends can be recognized and the prediction of user-preferred YouTube videos can then be enhanced.

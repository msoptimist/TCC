Abstract

Over the past two decades, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has received worldwide attention. Publication of CSR reports has become the trend for domestic and foreign enterprises. In the constantly changing and competitive corporate environment, public attention has come to be focused on how enterprises play the role of corporate citizen, and how they achieve a balance of profitable, environmental and charitable activities. However, most quantitative CSR studies to date have concentrated on traditional statistical approaches. The data mining technique has not been widely explored in this area. Thus, this investigation proposes a hybrid data mining CSFSC model, which stands for the first letters of CFS, SMOTE, FCM, SVMOAO and C5.0, integrating data-preprocessing approaches, a classification method and a rule generation mechanism for analyzing CSR data. The data-preprocessing approaches include correlation-based feature selection (CFS), the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The support vector machine one-against-one (SVMOAO) method was employed as a classifier for performing multiclassification, and the C5.0 decision tree algorithm was utilized to generate rules from the results of the SVMOAO model. In this study, CSR data collected from China’s listed firms in 2010 were used to test the performance of the proposed model. The empirical results showed that the designed CSFSC model yields satisfactory classification accuracy, and can provide rules for decision makers. Therefore, the presented CSFSC model is a feasible and effective alternative in analyzing CSR data.

1 Introduction

The concept of CSR is that enterprises create profit while upholding responsibility in regard to shareholders, employees, communities, the ecological environment and consumers. Many studies found that 80 % of enterprises actively published reports related to CSR activities in their annual reports [ 4 ]. CSR has gradually been integrated into organizations and become an important part of enterprise operation. Therefore, engaging in positive CSR activities has become an important way for enterprises to improve their competitiveness. Enterprises not only pursue the maximization of shareholders’ profit, but also take into account employees, consumers, the environment and community. Bearing this in mind, for the sake of sustainable management, the incorporation of CSR will become a future development trend of business strategy.

There is a growing trend of related researches on CSR in both industry and academia. As opposed to traditional investment, investors now attempt to apply the concept of CSR to investments, and look forward to obtaining higher interest. While a variety of previous quantitative studies have focused on statistical analysis to explore the effect of CSR on the financial performance of, or its importance to, enterprises, data mining techniques have rarely been applied to the analysis of CSR issues. In recent years, a wave of CSR has also arisen in China. According to Zairi and Peters’ [ 56 ] report, when enterprises fulfill their social responsibility, this will have a positive impact on their corporate image and help to maintain their competitive advantage. The emergence and development of CSR in China are especially important [ 50 ]. Thus, the RANKINS CSR RATINGS (RKS, http://www.rksratings.com/ ), which were collected by a third-party rating agency in China, were employed for the study in this investigation.

According to the broad definition by the World Business Council for Sustainability and Development, CSR is the ethical behavior of enterprises and its effect on society. Business Social Responsibility states that CSR signifies an enterprise upholding ethical values and respecting human rights, communities and the natural environment. Moreover, Weber [ 55 ] believed that CSR could enhance the corporate image and reputation, and help organizations to improve sales and the positive attitude of staff, while saving costs and improving financial performance. However, as CSR may depend on differences in culture or industries, the practical applications of CSR all over the world are different. Bowen [ 5 ] stated that the obligations of corporations must be established in order for business activities to conform to societal expectations. However, over time, several studies have offered alternative definitions of CSR. Friedman [ 17 ] argued that public activities for solving social problems are not duties of corporations, but the prerogative and obligation of governments. Additionally, Davis and Blomstrom [ 13 ] indicated that in pursuing the shareholders’ profit, decision makers have to act to protect and promote social well-being. Nevertheless, the most widely accepted definition is Carroll’s [ 7 ]; it stated that CSR includes four levels: economic, legal, ethical and discretionary. Freeman [ 16 ] stated that CSR was the performance of a company not only to satisfy shareholders as a standard, but also to offer value to customers, employees, suppliers, communities and society. Michael Porter [ 43 ] considered that combining social responsibility with operating strategies was the new method of increasing the competitiveness of a company. Thus, the emergence of CSR helps to improve corporate image, enterprise value and brand value.

Some quantitative studies of CSR are investigated as follows. Huseynov and Klamm [ 27 ] used multivariate regression analysis to deal with S&P audit fee data from KLD STATS, and to study tax management and effective tax rates. The results showed that CSR significantly impacted corporate tax avoidance. Kong [ 34 ] used regression analysis to explore cumulative abnormal returns on CSR level and to analyze the influences of CSR on investors’ behaviors in the food industry in China. The findings revealed that CSR can influence investors’ trading behaviors in a short period of time. Garay and Font [ 19 ] investigated CSR reasons, practices and impacts in small and medium accommodation enterprises by using correlation analysis. Their results revealed that the main reason for engaging in CSR is altruistic and that a high correlation exists between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP). Galbreath and Shum [ 18 ] employed confirmatory factor analysis, principal component analysis and factor analysis to study the relationship between CSR and firm performance. The results indicated that CSR is related to reputation and customer satisfaction and that reputation mediates the CSR and firm performance relationship. Inoue and Lee [ 30 ] applied the ordinary least-squares regression technique to investigate the effects of five dimensions (community, diversity, employees, natural environment and product) of CSR on CFP in tourism-related industries from the KLD STATS database. The experiment results showed that the four tourism-related industries (airline, casino, hotel and restaurant industries) could improve financial performance through each CSR dimension. Smith and Langford [ 47 ] employed confirmatory factor analysis to explore the impact between CSR, employee engagement and traditional human resource practices. They reported that CSR and employee engagement have a significant positive correlation, but that there was no obvious correlation between CSR and traditional human resource practices. Rahim et al. [ 45 ] applied multiple linear regression analysis to investigate the influence of CSR on consumer behavior in Malaysia. The results showed an obvious positive relationship between CSR and the buying behavior of consumers. Ghoul et al. [ 22 ] used descriptive statistics and the Pearson pairwise correlation to study whether CSR affected the cost of capital. They reported that the better the CSR scores of firms, the cheaper the equity finance they have. Chiu and Sharfman [ 10 ] employed correlation analysis, Kruskal–Wallis analysis and hierarchical regression analysis to examine the perspectives of legitimacy, visibility and the antecedents of corporate social performance (CSP). The results indicated that more profitable enterprises may not actively engage in CSP unless they are subject to a more rigorous review by various corporation stakeholders. Usunier et al. [ 51 ] applied confirmatory factor analysis, multivariate analysis of covariance and hierarchical regression analysis to study CSR compatibility for multinational corporations. They found that for multinational corporations with great power gaps between countries, loose corporate governance and complete business training, social responsibility is considered to be relatively incompatible with economic responsibility. Choi et al. [ 11 ] employed cross-sectional regression analysis and two-stage least-squares regression analysis to investigate the relationship between CSR and CFP in Korea. The results showed that stakeholder-weighted CSR index and CFP have a significantly positive correlation, but the equal-weighted CSR index does not. Tang and Li [ 50 ] employed factor analysis to analyze CSR communication of Chinese and global corporations in China. They reported that companies usually take one of the following three major approaches in their CSR communication: CSR as ad hoc public philanthropy, CSR as strategic philanthropy and CSR as ethical business practices. Baden et al. [ 1 ] applied co-relational analysis to study the effect of buyer pressure on suppliers in small- and medium-sized enterprises in the UK to display CSR practices. They found that most respondents agreed that CSR can act as an incentive to make suppliers more responsible, particularly in environmental criteria, and concluded that encouraging small- and medium-sized enterprises to engage in CSR would be an effective strategy in supply chains. Consolandi et al. [ 12 ] employed probability distributions and portfolio allocation to explore the rationality and ethical preferences of investors. Their findings indicated that subjects’ behavior was based not only on their individual payoffs, but also on the information of the ethical standards. Husted and Allen [ 28 ] analyzed the strategy and value creation of CSR among large firms in Spain and found that CSR can be managed for value creation. Siegel and Vitaliano [ 46 ] employed descriptive statistics and correlation matrix to study the importance of product type or service to managers when investing in CSR. The results showed that the firms selling durable experience goods or credence services are much more socially responsible than other firms. Maignan and Ferrell [ 37 ] used factor analysis to compare how consumers in the USA, France and Germany evaluate CSR toward both society and organizational stakeholders. They reported that there are significant differences between the USA and the two European nations and that guidance was provided to build the image of a responsible organization internationally. McWilliams and Siegel [ 38 ] employed descriptive statistics and correlation matrix to estimate the effect of CSR on CSP. The results indicated that CSP, research and design were highly correlated. Moreover, when research and design intensity is included in their estimated model, CSP is shown to have a neutral effect on profitability. Some assumptions of conventional statistical approaches such as linearity, normality and independence among independent variables and predefined functional forms of dependent variables and independent variables restrict applications of statistical techniques in the real world [ 25 ].

In this study, several techniques were integrated into the developed CSFSC model in order to analyze CSR data. First, in data preprocessing, CFS [ 23 ], SMOTE [ 8 ] and FCM clustering algorithm [ 3 ] were employed to extract essential attributes, cope with imbalanced data distribution and exclude extreme outliers, respectively. Second, the SVMOAO classifier was used to deal with the multiclassification problem. Third, the C5.0 decision tree algorithm [ 44 ] was utilized to yield rules for decision makers. The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section  2 introduces methodologies used in this study. Section  3 describes the CSFCS model. A numerical example and experiment results are discussed in Sect. 4 . Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5 .
2 Methodology
2.1 Correlation-based feature selection
Feature selection, as one of the preprocessing steps in data mining, is an important issue in reducing irrelevant attributes. CFS has been applied in various fields, such as fault detection of automobile engines [ 21 ], biomedical engineering [ 24 ] and the study of diabetes [ 32 ]. In this investigation, the CFSBFS method, a combination of CFS and best-first search algorithms, was used to identify important attributes. The CFS algorithm is a heuristic for evaluating the importance of features. This heuristic technique takes account of the usefulness of individual features for predicting class labels. The CFS is expressed as Eq. ( 1 ):
$$ A_{{\mathcal{F}}} = \frac{{\rho \overline{{{\mathcal{W}}\beta f}} }}{{\sqrt {\rho + \rho \left( {\rho - 1} \right)\overline{{{\mathcal{W}}ff}} } }} $$
(1)
where \( {\text{A}}_{{\mathcal{F}}} \) is the merit of a feature subset \( {\mathcal{F}} \) including \( \rho \) features; \( \overline{{{\mathcal{W}}\beta f}} \) is the average feature and class correlation average; and \( \overline{{{\mathcal{W}}{\text{ff}}}} \) is the average feature to feature correlations, respectively, where \( f \in {\mathcal{F}} \) . The heuristic handles irrelevant features, as they are bad predictors of the class. Redundant attributes are eliminated when they are highly correlated with the other features [ 23 ].
2.2 Synthetic minority over-sampling technique
Generating synthetic data by operating in the feature space rather than the data space, SMOTE generates real data by introducing synthetic examples, not by replacing minority classes. Furthermore, it can also deal with the over-fitting problem, and the classification performance is much higher than random over-sampling [ 2 , 8 ]. SMOTE became a commonly used in the classification of imbalanced data and was used in several fields, such as medical image recognition [ 54 ] and the UCI database [ 36 , 48 ]. The SMOTE algorithm is expressed as follows. First, choose the sample O and its nearest neighbors Õ randomly, and take the difference between them. Then, the difference is multiplied by a random number between 0 and 1, and the result is added to the sample. The new sample is defined as:
$$ O_{\text{new}} = O + {\text{rand}}\left( {0,1} \right) \times (\ O - O). $$
(2)
2.3 Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm
FCM applies fuzzy logic to enhance the stability and accuracy of clustering. The FCM method is an unsupervised technique that has been successfully applied in many fields, such as image segmentation [ 14 , 26 , 49 ], medical image recognition [ 31 ], knowledge systems in forest fires [ 29 ], audio signal classification [ 42 ] and semiconductor fabrication [ 9 ]. The FCM algorithm applies a membership function to calculate a membership value between 0 and 1 for each sample. Each sample has different membership values for different clusters. A sample belongs to a certain cluster when that sample’s membership value to a certain cluster is higher than the others. Through the previous process, the cluster boundary becomes smooth or overlapping. The FCM performs this procedure recursively until all samples are assigned to a cluster. Let \( Y = \left\{ {y_{1,} y_{2, \ldots ,} y_{M} } \right\} \) denote a dataset containing M samples. The expected number of clustering is \( G = \left\{ {G_{1,} G_{2, \ldots ,} G_{C} } \right\} \) . The aim of FCM is to partition the sample \( Y \) to all G clusters using the weighted distance. Let \( J_{F} \) be the objective function. The purpose of FCM is to minimize the following objective function:
$$ {\text{Min}}\,J_{F} = \mathop \sum \limits_{v = 1}^{C} \mathop \sum \limits_{j = 1}^{M} W_{jv}^{q} \left\| {y_{j} - u_{v} } \right\|^{2} $$
(3)
s.t.
$$ \mathop \sum \limits_{v = 1}^{C} W_{jv} = 1,\quad j = 1,2, \ldots ,M $$
(4)
where \( q \) presents the exponent on each fuzzy membership, \( u_{v} \) is the center of the v th cluster and \( W_{jv} \) is the membership degree of \( y_{j} \) in cluster v . Then, the membership degree and the center of the cluster are computed as follows:
$$ W_{jv} = {1 \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {1 {\mathop \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{C} \left( {\frac{{y_{j} - u_{v} }}{{y_{j} - u_{i} }}} \right)^{{2/\left( {q - 1} \right)}} }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\mathop \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{C} \left( {\frac{{y_{j} - u_{v} }}{{y_{j} - u_{i} }}} \right)^{{2/\left( {q - 1} \right)}} }} $$
(5)
and
$$ u_{v} = \frac{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{k = 1}^{M} W_{kv}^{q} \cdot y_{k} }}{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{k = 1}^{M} W_{kv}^{q} }} $$
(6)
By finding the center of the cluster and seeking the membership function repeatedly, this procedure stops when the value of the objective function is less than a predetermined value or the procedure reaches the maximum number of iterations.
2.4 Support vector machine one-against-one

Proposed by Vapnik [ 52 ], SVM is an efficient method which mainly deals with binary classification. However, in the real-world, multiclass problems are more than two class problems. In this investigation, the support vector machine one-against-one (SVMOAO) method [ 33 ] was employed. A number of investigations have applied SVMOAO in many fields, such as machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis [ 53 ], medical image recognition [ 15 ] and UCI databases [ 35 ]. Generally, SVM is based on structure risk minimization and is utilized to deal with linear and nonlinear problems of binary classification. The goal of SVM is to find an optimal hyperplane that can separate the classes and maintain maximum distance from both classes. If the data are nonlinearly separated, the input vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional vector space. Through the nonlinear mapping, SVM can construct a linear model to estimate a decision function by the largest margin between the hyperplane and the support vectors. The basic form of the SVM classifier is formulated as follows.
Let \( \left\{ {x_{k} , y_{k} } \right\} \) , k  = 1,2,…, s be the training dataset with input \( x_{k} \in R^{m} \) , and \( y_{k} \in \left\{ { \pm 1} \right\} \) represent the corresponding class label. SVM finds the optimal separating hyperplane with the largest margin. For separating two classes, the maximum separating margin is a constrained optimization problem represented by Eqs. ( 7 ) and ( 8 ):
$$ {\text{Minimize}}\,\frac{1}{2}w^{2} + C\mathop \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{s} \varphi_{k} $$
(7)
$$ {\text{subject}}\,{\text{to}}\,y_{k} \left( {wx_{k} + b} \right) \ge 1 - \varphi_{k} ,\varphi_{k} \ge 0\quad {\text{for}}\,k = 1,2, \ldots ,s $$
(8)
where w is a weight vector, \( \varphi \) is a slack parameter used for fault tolerance, C is the penalty parameter that controls the trade-off between decision function and wrongly classified testing samples, and b is a bias. The dual problem is transformed into quadratic programming by Lagrange multipliers. The solution to Eqs. ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) can be expressed as:
$$ {\text{Maximize}}\,\mathop \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{s} \pi_{k} - \frac{1}{2}\mathop \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{s} \mathop \sum \limits_{j = 1}^{s} y_{k} y_{j} \pi_{k} \pi_{j} K\left( {x_{k} ,x_{j} } \right) $$
(9)
$$ {\text{subject}}\,{\text{to}}\,\mathop \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{s} \pi_{k} y_{k} = 0,\,0 \le \pi_{k} \le C\quad {\text{for}}\,k = 1,2, \ldots ,s $$
(10)
where π is a Lagrange multiplier, and \( K\left( {x_{k} ,x_{j} } \right) = \varGamma \left( {x_{k} } \right) \cdot \varGamma \left( {x_{j} } \right) \) is the kernel function which is applied to map the input vector space to higher-dimensional vector space from nonlinearly separable data, so that the problem can become linearly separable. By the previous equations, we can obtain the location of support vectors, and the hyperplane is defined by the support vectors. The decision function can be represented as Eq. ( 11 ):
$$ D\left( {x_{k} } \right) = {\text{sign}}\left[ {\mathop \sum \limits_{k = 1}^{s} \pi_{k} y_{k} K\left( {x,x_{k} } \right) + b} \right]\quad k = 1,2, \ldots ,s $$
(11)
In this investigation, the radial basis function was used as a kernel function and shown as Eq. ( 12 ):
$$ K\left( {x,x_{k} } \right) = \exp \left( { - x - x_{k}^{2} /2\sigma^{2} } \right) $$
(12)
However, the above discussion deals with only the binary classification, and not multiclass problems. The SVMOAO method can solve multiclass classification problems. The SVMOAO method constructs \( k(k - 1)/2 \) classifiers, using all the binary pairwise combinations of \( k \) classes, and the i th SVM is trained on data from two classes. We deal with the binary classification problem by training data from the i th and the j th classes, expressed as Eqs. ( 13 ) to ( 16 ):
$$ {\text{Minimize}}\, \frac{1}{2}\left\| {w^{Kj}} \right\|^2 + C\mathop \sum \limits_{d = 1}^{s} \varphi_{d}^{kj} \left( {w^{kj} } \right)^{T} $$
(13)
$$ {\text{Subject}}\,{\text{to}} \left( {w^{kj} } \right)^{T} \theta \left( {x_{d} } \right) + b^{kj} \ge 1 - \varphi_{d}^{kj} \quad {\text{if}}\quad y_{d} = k, $$
(14)
$$ \left( {w^{kj} } \right)^{T} \theta \left( {x_{d} } \right) + b^{kj} \le - 1 + \varphi_{d}^{kj} \quad {\text{if}}\quad y_{d} = j, $$
(15)
$$ \varphi_{d}^{kj} \ge 0,\quad j = 1, \ldots ,\zeta $$
(16)
The super index T denotes the matrix transpose. We employ the largest vote to predict x in the class. After calculating sign \( \left[ {\left( {w^{ij} } \right)^{T} \theta \left( x \right) + b^{kj} } \right] \) , if \( x \) in the i th class, then the k th class increases by one; if not, the j th class increases by one.
2.5 C5.0 decision tree algorithms
In order to find the best attribute with classification ability, the C5.0 decision tree calculates Information Gain and leaves threshold. Then, the dataset is divided into multiple subsets by the best attribute. For each subset, this process is conducted recursively and finds other subsets until all subsets contain only one attribute or the number of samples is smaller than a certain threshold. Moreover, by carrying out the merger, or pruning each leaf of the decision tree, C5.0 algorithm improves the precision of the decision tree classification. Suppose set α contains n samples. The decision attribute D and each sample belong to different classes \( D_{i} \) ( i  = 1, 2… u ). Let \( r_{i} \) be the number of class \( D_{i} \) samples. The Information Entropy is then defined as Eq. ( 17 ):
$$ E\left( \alpha \right) = - \mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{u} \theta_{i} \log_{2} (\theta_{i} ) $$
(17)
where \( \theta_{i} = r_{i} /\left| \alpha \right| \) represents the proportion of the number of class \( D_{i} \) samples to the number of all samples. Let attribute f have \( \tau \) different values which divide the set \( \alpha \) into \( \tau \) subsets. Then, calculate the dataset \( \alpha \) under the attribute f as Conditional Information Entropy. The equation is shown as follows:
$$ E\left( {\alpha |f} \right) = - \mathop \sum \limits_{j = 1}^{\tau } \theta_{j}^{'} \mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{u} \theta_{ij} \log_{2} \left( {\theta_{ij} } \right) $$
(18)
where \( \theta_{j}^{{\prime }} \) denotes the proportion of the sample number with attribute value \( f_{j} \) to the number of all samples. \( \theta_{ij} = r_{ij} /\left| {\alpha_{j} } \right| \) ; \( \left| {\alpha_{j} } \right| \) is the number with attribute value \( f_{j} \) ; and \( r_{ij} \) is the number of samples with attribute value \( f_{j} \) belonging to class \( D_{i} \) . The next step is to calculate the Information Gain Ratio of attribute f . The functions are illustrated as follows:
$$ {\text{Gain}}\,\left( f \right) = E\left( \alpha \right) - E\left( {\alpha |f} \right) $$
(19)
$$ {\text{Split}}\,\left( f \right) = - \mathop \sum \limits_{j = 1}^{\tau } \theta_{j}^{{\prime }} \log_{2} (\theta_{j}^{{\prime }} ) $$
(20)
$$ {\text{Gain}}\,{\text{Ratio}}\,\left( f \right) = {\text{Gain}}\,\left( f \right)/{\text{Split}}\,\left( f \right) $$
(21)

After calculating the Information Gain Ratio of all attributes, the C5.0 algorithm selects the attribute with the largest value and creates a new node for each subset. For each new node, the procedure described above is repeated. In order to avoid over-fitting, the decision tree must be pruned by removing the less reliable branches to generate more accurate results. The C5.0 algorithm uses two pruning methods: prepruning [ 40 ] and postpruning [ 6 , 39 ]. The prepruning method splits the tree until the stop threshold of the classification tree is reached. In contrast, the postpruning approach builds a complete tree and determines which branch is to be pruned according to the error rate. Therefore, the prepruning approach is more subjective and is often based on local information, while postpruning is grounded on global information. In this study, the postpruning method is adopted by the C5.0 technique.
3 The proposed CSFSC model
Figure  1 shows the flowchart of the presented CSFSC model. First, the CSR reports of China’s listed firms in 2010 from RKS database were collected as input for this study. Then, data-preprocessing procedures, including CFSBFS, SMOTE and FCM, were performed. The CFSBFS approach was used to select important condition attributes of CSR data. After attribute selection, the data were divided into five datasets to make a fivefold cross-validation (CV). Each dataset was split into two subsets: a training dataset (376 data), and a testing dataset (94 data). The training dataset was only for modeling the CSFSC model; the testing dataset was used to examine the performance of the proposed CSFSC model. Due to the imbalanced data for each category in the training datasets, we oversampled the training data by using the SMOTE approach in order to make the amount of training data of each class very close. Subsequently, extreme outliers were excluded by the FCM clustering algorithm. The preprocessed training data were input to the SVMOAO model to obtain training accuracy, and the testing dataset was employed to measure the performance of the developed CSFSC model. Finally, support vectors with the best CV results were used as input of the C5.0 decision tree to generate rules for decision makers. When the social environment changes, the measures of corporate social responsibility vary, too. Thus, new indices and data of corporate social responsibility can be processed by the proposed CSFSC model to yield useful information.

4.1 The data
The data used in this investigation were gathered from Rankins CSR Ratings in 2010. In addition to 40 data with missing values, in total, 470 original data were divided into 9 categories in descending order AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC and C. The distributions of the data are shown in Table  1 . The CSR report begins with four major indicators: macrocosm, content, technique and industry. The four major indicators were subdivided into 15 first-level indicators depicted in Table  2 . The 15 indicators were further subdivided into 64 s level indicators. Appendix Table  10 lists the second-level indicators. The 64-s level indicators were employed as condition attributes represented as numerical values; and the nine categories in Table  1 are decision attributes.

4.2 Experimental results
To mitigate the influence of over-fitting, a fivefold CV was used in this study. Feature selection was generated using the CFSBFS method, and 19 selected condition attributes are listed in Table  3 . The results of classification between the proposed CSFSC model with and without data-preprocessing procedures are illustrated in Table  4 . According to Table  4 , it can be seen that the CSFSC model with data-preprocessing procedures obtains much higher average testing accuracy than the model without data-preprocessing procedures.

In addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was employed to verify attributes selected by the CFSBFS feature selection method. The results showed that the selected condition attributes are highly correlated with decision attributes. Nunnally [ 41 ] noted that high correlation implies that the correlation coefficient is higher than 0.7. Thus, the 18 condition attributes determined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient with absolute values higher than 0.7 are T4, M3, M1, M2, T5, T6, T16, M13, M14, M15, M6, C4, M8, C8, M11, C5, T17 and C7. Of the 18 selected condition attributes, the 11 attributes selected by CFSBFS are T4, M3, M1, M2, M15, M6, C4, M8, C8, M11 and C5. That indicates the CFSBFS method, and the Pearson correlation coefficient technique has common results of feature selection to a certain degree. In order to obtain appropriate support vectors, the dataset of CV4, whose testing accuracy is the highest in the CSFSC model, was used to generate rules by the C5.0 decision tree. Appendix Table  11 lists 20 selected rules derived from the CSFSC model.
Furthermore, from the statistical aspect, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach was employed to explore the interactions between condition attributes. For instance, two condition attributes, completeness and information on the communication of stakeholders, were investigated. The experimental results of two-way ANOVA, in Table  5 , show that the interaction effect between completeness and information on the communication of stakeholders is significant. Moreover, the simple main effect of completeness under “information on the communication of stakeholders is between 2.5 and 3.472” was analyzed, as shown in Table  6 . The results indicate that the completeness has significant influence on the CSR level. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons among completeness under “information on the communication of stakeholders is between 2.5 and 3.472” were conducted, and Table  7 shows the results. In Table  8 , two rules can be generated from the results in Table  7 . Then, Table  9 illustrates rules yielded by the CFSFS model when two condition attributes, completeness and information on the communication of stakeholders, are considered. Both the ANOVA approach and the CFSFS model can generate rules. However, the ANOVA method has to determine condition attributes in advance, and more condition attributes may increase the computational complexity. In addition, the CFSFS model can present much clearer and informative rules, but the ANOVA technique can only compare condition attributes.

5 Conclusion

The importance of CSR is that it can help enterprises better coordinate economic, social and environmental development and competition, enhance company culture and employee relationships, maintain friendly relationships with the community, and achieve good risk management and social opportunities. Moreover, it can also increase the competitiveness of corporations. In this investigation, a CSFSC model was presented to analyze the CSR issue in China. This investigation is the first to apply a data mining-based model to analyze CSR data; this study found that data-preprocessing procedures can effectively decrease the complexity of problems and increase classification accuracy. The proposed CSFSC model is more suitable than statistic approaches because it provides clear, efficient and informative rules in analyzing the CSR issue. By adjusting values of CSR measures, the CSFSC model can provide directions for improving CSR levels. In the future, the designed CSFSC model can be used to deal with other CSR databases to examine the feasibility of the CSFSC model. Another possible direction for future study is the creation of a user-friendly interface for decision makers.

        <dcterms:abstract>Purpose Data mining has been a popular research area in the past decades. Many researchers study data-mining theories, methods, applications and trends; however, there are very few studies on data-mining-related topics in social media. This paper aims to explore the topics related to data mining based on the data collected from Wikipedia. Design/methodology/approach In total, 402 data-mining-related articles were obtained from Wikipedia. These articles were manually classified into several categories by the coding method. Each category formed an article-term matrix. These matrices were analysed and visualized by the self-organizing map approach. Several clusters were observed in each category. Finally, the topics of these clusters were extracted by content analysis. Findings The articles obtained were classified into six categories: applications, foundation and concepts, methodologies, organizations, related fields and topics and technology support. Business, biology and security were the three prominent topics of the applications category. The technologies supporting data mining were software, systems, databases, programming languages and so forth. The general public was more interested in data-mining organizations than the researchers. They also focused on the applications of data mining in business more than in other fields. Originality/value This study will help researchers gain insight into the general public?s perceptions of data mining and discover the gap between the general public and themselves. It will assist researchers in finding new techniques and methods which will potentially provide them with new data-mining methods and research topics.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Purpose ? Twitter is an increasingly popular social networking tool for libraries to use to reach out to their patrons, but very little research has been done to determine who is following library tweets. The aim of the paper is to use the existing Twitter follower information for the Sterling Evans Library at Texas A&amp;M as a test bed to determine the composition of Evans Twitter followers. The Medical Sciences Library's primary user groups are made up largely of graduate and professional students, making the difference in the number of graduate and undergraduate followers of particular interest.Design/methodology/approach ? Follower data were gathered from the Evans Twitter page and each user was identified and categorized. Additional data were collected on the number of tweets, and the state of the account, active or inactive.Findings ? A total of 432 follower accounts were examined. A total of 54.37 percent were identified as affiliated with Texas A&amp;M University. The largest group of followers were students (23.61 percent), made up primarily of undergraduates (81.05 percent). Faculty/staff (7.64 percent) showed very little participation. Unaffiliated followers included corporations (19.68 percent), alumni (11.57 percent), and other libraries or librarians (7.64 percent).Originality/value ? Very little can be found in the library literature on Twitter follower analysis. This is the first large and detailed analysis of library Twitter followers.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Purpose ? It is difficult to build our own social data set because data in social media is generally too vast and noisy. The aim of this study is to specify design and implementation details of the Twitter data collecting tool with a rule?based filtering module. Additionally, the paper aims to see how people communicate with each other through social networks in a case study with rule?based analysis.Design/methodology/approach ? The authors developed a java?based data gathering tool with a rule?based filtering module for collecting data from Twitter. This paper introduces the design specifications and explain the implementation details of the Twitter Data Collecting Tool with detailed Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. The Model View Controller (MVC) framework is applied in this system to support various types of user interfaces.Findings ? The Twitter Data Collecting Tool is able to gather a huge amount of data from Twitter and filter the data with modest rules for complex logic. This case study shows that a historical event creates buzz on Twitter and people's interests on the event are reflected in their Twitter activity.Research limitations/implications ? Applying data?mining techniques to the social network data has so much potential. A possible improvement to the Twitter Data Collecting Tool would be an adaptation of a built?in data?mining module.Originality/value ? This paper focuses on designing a system handling massive amounts of Twitter Data. This is the first approach to embed a rule engine for filtering and analyzing social data. This paper will be valuable to those who may want to build their own Twitter dataset, apply customized filtering options to get rid of unnecessary, noisy data, and analyze social data to discover new knowledge.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dcterms:abstract>Purpose Online customer reviews could shed light into their experience, opinions, feelings, and concerns. To gain valuable knowledge about customers, it becomes increasingly important for businesses to collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize online customer reviews posted on social media platforms such as online forums. However, analyzing social media data is challenging due to the vast increase of social media data. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach of using natural language preprocessing, text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze online customer reviews related to various hotels through a case study. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a tested approach of using natural language preprocessing, text mining, and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze online textual content. The value of the proposed approach was demonstrated through a case study using online hotel reviews. Findings The study found that the overall review star rating correlates pretty well with the sentiment scores for both the title and the full content of the online customer review. The case study also revealed that both extremely satisfied and extremely dissatisfied hotel customers share a common interest in the five categories: food, location, rooms, service, and staff. Originality/value This study analyzed the online reviews from English-speaking hotel customers in China to understand their preferred hotel attributes, main concerns or demands. This study also provides a feasible approach and a case study as an example to help enterprises more effectively apply social media analytics in practice.</dcterms:abstract>
